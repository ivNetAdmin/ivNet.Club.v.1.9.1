5,Due to a complete over sight by NK no team had been selected for this match. Very annoying,Nigel,2010-02-11

8,<p>Only 3 overs were possible at a very soggy Ballinger . In some corners this was greeted with sighs of relief as 8pts may have been more than the team would have achieved against a strong Broomwade side</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
9,<p>On the opening day of the season Ballinger were greeted with an excellent track## a short boundary and an Aldenham side short of bowlers. Rollo McIntyre took full advantage of all this and bludgeoned 120n.o. in no time. He added 206 for the second wicket with Matt Riley. Riley scored 70 at a more stately speed. Ballinger declared on 218 - 2 with only skipper Salisbury missing out.</p><p>Aldenham's batting was some-what better than their bowling and with the track still playing well they reached 190-7. All the Ballinger bowlers performed well but it was particularly pleasing to see the spin duo## Davies & Hardy## bowling well in tandem. New 'keeper Riley did an excellent job behind the sticks.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
11,<p>They don't come any closer than this! Ballinger win a cliff hanger of a cup game against Flackwell Heath.</p> <p> Flackwell batted first and were contained by a tidy opening spell by Luke Hughes and Charlie Mead. At the mid point of the 20 overs they accelerated but were then pegged back towards the close of their innings by two good spells by James Rose and Sebastian Richards who each bowled two overs and took two wickets for 5 runs. At the close Flackwell had scored 60. However the grass in the outfield was very long and we reckoned that it was worth 80 to 90 at our ground.</p><p>Ballinger lost Alex Humphreys early to a very good catch. George Bailey and George Kinston then both batted well and gave us a good base. They were both dismissed for 11## which on a better outfield would have been worth a lot more. Charlie Mead came in at second wicket down and batted really well to accumulate 25. Ballinger were well on course until Charlie was out and then the middle order lost composure as the run chase was reaching its climax.</p> <p> The light was poor as the last over was bowled with Ballinger still needing two to win. A wicket fell and Matthew Rose joined Sebastian Richards at the crease. A dot ball was followed by a scampered single (encouraged from a rather vocal square leg umpire!). Basty was now on strike. Three balls left one run to win. Two dot balls. One delivery left - one run required. The tension was mounting. Basty middled a leg stump delivery which went crashing past mid on and Ballinger had won.</p> The team bowled and fielded well. Next match we need to cut down on the opposition's singles and scramble a few more of our own. All in all a very credible performance by the team with every one contributing with either bat or ball and in the end a thoroughly deserved victory.Paul Rose,Nigel,2010-02-11
12,<p>On a beautiful spring evening BWCC U11A's got off to a disappointing start to the season. Playing off 22yards!! </p>Ballinger put Beaconsfield in to bat and they took full advantage of the difficulty some bowlers were having bowling on a longer than usual pitch and were rattling up the runs. They were helped by some some beginning of the season sloppy fielding & after their 20 overs they were 273 for 4 with Tom Edmonds getting 8 for 32 off 2 overs. Will Smith kept really well.</p><p>After the first 2 pairs we were only 4 runs behind but our inability to pierce the field meant when the last pair came in they needed to make 38 runs in 4 overs. This proved an impossible task.</p><p>We need to put this behind us and in the next match## ensure our fielding is up to Ballingers usual standard## bowl a good length and look for the gaps in the field to get boundaries.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
13,<p>When the teams arrived at the ground the game was in doubt due to a wet out-field and light rain. However the 2 team coaches agreed to start the game and review the situation after 3-4 overs. The game was played under Barrington rules and Amesham won the toss and asked BWCC to bat first. Once the game was underway the weather improved immensely and soon the sun was shining and the outfield was not as slippery as we thought it might be. </p> <p> The BWCC opening pair gave the team a steady start despite loosing an early wicket. Subsequent pairs batted sensibly and carefully and kept the score ticking over. The final pair scored 26 runs to set a target of 265 runs. In total BWCC lost 5 wickets. There was good batting performances from Jamie Wise## Josh Livingstone## Monty Cuthbert## Alex Welsh and Joe Carey. </p> <p>When Amersham batted## the BWCC bowlers bowled a very good line and length and prevented Amersham from scoring too many runs. The BWCC fielding was excellent with good backing-up from the players plus lots of encouragement from each boy to their team members. The BWCC bowlers conceeded many fewer extras than the Amersham bowlers. </p> <p> What was particularly pleasing was that only one bye and only 3 additional runs from wide deliveries were conceeded - well done to Alex Wills for keeping wicket so well. In the end BWCC only took 3 wickets - 2 in the final over. However their overall bowling performance restricted the Amersham batsmen.</p> <p>Josh Livingstone captained the side well and all the team members accepted his field placings without question. There were good bowling performances from Max Bailey## who took all 3 wickets## Duncan Healey## Eddie Bentley## Tom Harrison and John Martin.</p> <p>I would like to thank Jeff Moxom for umpiring the match - with the permission of Amersham CC officials.</p> <p>Finally all the boys behaved impeccably and were a credit to the club.</p> <p>Thanks to all the parents for suppporting the boys.</p> <p>Chris Moxom BWCC Coach.BWCC 264-5 Amersham 235-3,Chris,2010-02-11
14,<p>The game started on a damp Sunday morning. There was a slight mix-up with the times in that Aston Clinton thought the game started at 10. However the match proceeded as soon as possible and Aston Clinton won the toss and asked BWCC to bat.</p> <p> Stephan Otto and George Barlett opened the batting and proceeded to make steady progress against the very good Aston opening bowlers. Stephan and George put on 23 in 7 overs before George was out for 7. James Wood came in at number 3.. </p> <p>Sadly## as the match progressed## the strip become much more slippery and it began to cut-up. The home umpire proposed that the game be abandoned because of the potential risk of injury to both bowlers and batsmen. After a brief discussion between the coaches of both teams it was agreed to abandon the game. </p> <p>At this point Stephan was 11 not out and James 6 not out. All three BWCC batsmen had batted very well in the difficult conditions. </p> <p>The full team wasStephan Otto## George Barlett## James Wood## Jeff Moxom## James Miller## Jack MacIver## Luke Martin (capt.)## Jonny Freeman## Aaron Bailey## Michael Bryant## Richard Wise.BWCC U14 29-1 (9 overs),Chris,2010-02-11
17,High Wycombe proved too strong for us on Thursday evening. Wycombe batted first and were restricted to 32 off their first 10 overs## however## they accelerated to reach 83 for 4 after 20. All the bowlers bowled well and kept their heads when confronted by some clean striking of a cricket ball by some of the Wycombe batsmen. The fielding was also of a good standard and to limit a side with a number of county players to 83 in 20 overs was a very commendable performance. Will Clarke and George Bailey both bowled 3 over and took 1 for 7## which was an excellent analysis on an evening made for batting.Unfortunately we struggled with the bat. The opposition were quick and pretty straight## which proved a lethal combination for most of our players. Sam King put up some good resistance and scored 9. James Rose showed a commendably good technique and occupied the crease without adding much to the score. We were eventually bowled out for 33. I would be surprised if we come up against a bowling attack as good as that again this season. Having said that## we need to look closely at our basic technique## ie getting in line and playing straight to straight balls.There is no need to feel disheartened by defeat to a very competent opposition. And the boys now go on to a league match at Amersham followed by cup game at home to Beaconsfield on Monday 15th May.Paul Rose,Paul,2010-02-11
18,<p>With a school game at The Beacon not due to finish until 6.30## Ballinger had no choice but to start the game with 5 players (including 2 subs.) which had a major impact on the batting order. This was no way to start a game against a strong Chesham side including several county players. Chesham sportingly agreed that Ballinger should bat first on a wicket with variable bounce and a great deal of sideways movement. 100 would have been a good score.</p><p>The first few overs were negotiated safely until the wicket's variable bounce played its part in accounting for the first two wickets. Adam clipped his 2nd ball over the deep square boundary and Alex & Tom (Watts) mixed good defence with sensible attaching shots. The score was on 31 after 12 overs & acceleration was needed. Woody and Stefan led the way with George & Kristian playing their part. Somehow we managed to scrape our way to 82.</p><p>Luke & Richard opened the bowling against as good a batsman as they will play against all season. Both gave it everything. Looking for inspiration Stefan then turned to James “golden arm” Stoddart who opened up with a double wicket maiden including the prize scalp - great catch by Stefan. Jack produced 4 tidy economical overs## picking up 1 wicket and Ballinger were now back in it. Ballinger kept up the pressure with the excellent ground fielding all the way through. 26 off 6 needed & the Chesham batsmen (and coaches) were starting to feel the pressure. Great catch by Luke followed by an equally good run out by Woody & the pressure continued to mount. George## now into his rhythm picks up 2 quick wickets. Kristian## Tom Sperring & Callum continued to set the example in the field & two runs are needed off the last ball. Unfortunately Chesham managed to scrape home in the dark.</p><p>Summary.Under the circumstances this really was a great team effort and hopefully everyone who played now knows they can compete (and beat) anyone they play against. On difficult wickets## against good quality bowling## patience is needed. We have to play straight. Extras on both sides were top score so the need to bowl straight (especially on this type of wicket) is key to defending a total.</p><p>A special mention to Tom S. & Callum. Your attitude & team spirit set the tone. Stefan## captaincy wise## that's as hard as it will get!</p> <p>Team: Stefan Otto## James Woods## Luke Martin## Richard Wise## James Stoddart## Jack Maciver## Callum Bright## Tom Sperring## Kristian Otto## George Bartlett## Adam Robinson.Subs - Alex Morgan## Tom Watts</p>,Ian,2010-02-11

20,<p>A determined and focused U13A team eased into the second round of the cup overcoming Gt. Kingshill. </p><p>On a damp and dreary Sunday morning Ballinger were put in after losing the toss. Sam Privett and Stefan Otto batted solidly to see off the dangerous Kingshill opening bowlers with Sam being a little unlucky to be run out. </p><p>Following the departure of the openers James Wood produced some beautifully timed drives on his way to 16. Luke Martin scored some quick fire runs before hitting all round a straight one and Tom Sperring batted well to reach double figures before smashing a drive straight to a Kingshill fielder who did well to hang on given the cold and damp conditions. At 66-5 off 14 overs though## Kingshill must have had hopes of restricting Ballinger to a reasonable score. James Stoddart however produced his best innings for Ballinger for some time mixing excellent strokeplay with intelligent running between the wickets. Well assisted by Jack MacIver and Tom Watts they pushed the score on to 102 after 20 overs. </p><p>The Kingshill reply started briskly reaching 26-0 after 4 overs. This was largely due to both Jack and Richard struggling with their footing. The introduction of James Stoddart brought immediate success (again!) bowling Kingshill's best batsman and along with Sam who bowled an excellent line and length pegged back the Kingshill reply with only 15 runs coming off their 8 overs. Off a shortened run up Jack still managed to fizz one past the edge of the batsman's bat with James Wood completing the dismissal with a good catch behind the wicket. Richard managed to conjure up an amazing run out hitting the stumps from out by the boundary. If the Kingshill batsman were hoping for some respite they didn't get it as Adam Robinson bowled quick and straight to finish off the tailenders. The bowlers were well supported in the field with Callum Bright and Tom Watts in the thick of the action. </p><p>Stefan again captained the team well## leading from the front and always giving encouragement and assistance to the team along with making sure the ball was as dry as possible for his bowlers! </p><p>In the end a comfortable win built on sensible batting## all the bowlers bowling a good line and length backed up by some solid fielding. </p><p>Scorecard:<br><b>Ballinger 102 for 6</b> (James Stoddart 16*## James Wood 16## Stefan Otto 12## Tom Sperring 10)</p><p><b>Gt Kingshill 58 all out</b> (Adam Robinson 3-2-3-3## James Stoddart 4-1-8-3## Sam Privett 4-2-7-1)</p>,Ian,2010-02-11
21,Taplow 168 - 4 (Declared)<br>Ballinger 169 - 8 <p>Ballinger captain## Ian Maciver## won the toss and decided to field on an overcast## muggy day at Taplow. Openers Lloyd and McNeil made good use of the conditions to bowl very tight opening spells## the batsmen finding it hard to score off the swinging ball. Lloyd was first to make a breakthrough with a diving catch off his own bowling (fortunately not followed by the 'twang' of breaking hip replacement components)## he also took the second wicket with a ball that surprised the batsmen by swinging right round his legs and striking leg stump. The openers were supported admirably by some fine bowling from Colts Stone## Hughes and Maciver Jnr (4 overs## 3 maidens) and a nine over spell of off-spin from Maciver Snr. The Taplow run-rate was not allowed to accelerate until after their no.4's solid inning of 53 was ended in the safe hands of Maw off the bowling of McNeil. This brought on Taplow's big-hitting no.5 who struck a quickfire 28 before skying one to Maciver Snr off Ballinger debutant Johnson. Taplow's innings ended with a score of 168 declared## at tea. </p><p>Ballinger's innings started steadily with both openers going for less than 10. Nos. 4 and 5 helped accelerate the scoring but both also went cheaply; McNeil swiping and missing a slow## looping full-toss which he thought would be called a no-ball## and possibly should have been## harmless though it was . . . except for hitting the stumps. This brought on Maciver Snr who## in a partnership of 67 with Kellock## helped steady the ship and put Ballinger in a position to take the game to Taplow. Kellock's solid knock of 54 ended with an acrobatic one-handed catch deep in the outfield. Maciver Snr was next to go## falling just short of his half century on 47. The game was left delicately poised with a handful of overs left to bowl and Ballinger 24 runs from victory. Phil Lloyd did the rest## along with a couple of low scoring tail-enders## Lloyd striking the ball imperiously to the boundary## including the only six of the game and the winning runs## a four off the first ball of the last over of the match. </p><p>A game played in beautiful surroundings## on a very fine wicket and in the true spirit of Sunday cricket was enjoyed equally (almost) by both teams. </p>MACIVER I(Captain) <br>KELLOCK(Wicket Keeper) <br>STONE<br>LLOYD<br>JOHNSON<br>MAW<br>McNEIL<br>MACIVER J<br>HUGHES K<br>HUGHES L<br>TIVEY,Jamie,2010-02-11

23,<p>Ballinger won the toss and decided to field first. Amersham got off to a flying start racing to 44-1 in 7 overs. Will Clark taking the wicket## which was well caught by Sam King. Amersham's opening batsman retired on 30. Captain James Rose took 2-13 (1 of these a very good caught and bowled) and James Butterworth had figures of 2-11 the second wicket a brilliant catch from Alex Humphrey## which put us back in the game. Then Charlie Mead came back to bowl and took 2-4 in his second spell to restrict Amersham to 103.</p> <p>We started our reply from a steady opening base from Alex Humphries (6) and James Rose (5) but both of those were out in quick succession leaving Charlie Mead and Sam King. They batted well for a couple of overs but then Charlie was unfortunate to be caught by a very good slip catch. Sam King and Robbie Branfield decided to attack the bowlers and crashed the ball to the boundaries## which gave Ballinger a glimmer of hope. When Sam King retired on 31 Robbie continued for about 4 overs before being caught for 12. Daniel Stockdale and Will Clark were both out quickly and we finished 28 short of Amersham ending on 75.</p>Team J.Rose (Capt.) A. Humphrey G. Kingston## C. Mead## S. King## R. Branfield## D.

24,<p>Ballinger and Ley Hill fought out another nail biter at LHCC on Saturday Batting first the Waggoners struggled to 167-9 with only skipper Matt Riley showing any form on a slow pitch.</p> <p>New opener Andy Branigan and Riley looked in no trouble but found it difficult to get the ball away. McIntyre's introduction at the fall of the first wicket soon upped the scoring until he was dismissed by a clever bit of ball juggling by the Hill's gulley fielder. A brief flurry from Davies and a turgid innings from Kerry meant another failure by Ballinger's middle order. Adams then came to the rescue with 25 off 10 balls and with a bit of help from the tail 167 was riches indeed.<p/><p>Skipper Riley then pulled off a master-stroke when he opened the bowling with Maciver. His left arm spin was very difficult to attack and with Adams as miserly as ever at the other end the Hill found runs equally difficult to acquire.</p><p>Slowly but surely Ballingers spin trio of Maciver## Davies and Lawson tightened their grip on the game but with the Hill's Rennard now in full flow would they be able to get the required run rate high enough to overcome the inevitable late charge.</p><p>Wickets were beginning to fall as the pressure built but slowly the Hill got closer and closer. Danger man Leadbetter was removed by Adams but then Rennard took 11 off Adams penultimate over. This left him on strike and only 14 needed off the last 2 overs. Lawson concede 8 off his last over and now the game had swung in the Hill's favour. The Hill were now on 162 for 6 needing just 6 to win off the last over. Adams to bowl. The first ball had Nick Lee caught at cover## 1 run off the second brought Rennard on strike then the stroke of luck that changes games. Having batted serenely for his 72 Rennard played on.</p><p>5 now required off 3 balls. A scampered single## then a 2 meant 2 required off the last ball. A good clean hit sent the ball steepling into the dark evening night## a roar went up from the Ley Hill crowd only to be stilled when Kerry calmly moved into position to take the catch.</p>A really good game of cricket## enjoyed by both sides.LHCC 166-9 BWCC 167-10,Nigel,2010-02-11
25,H+C very graciously played us## although expecting us the night before! It was a good win to start the season## although extras played a large part on both sides. Best batting and bowling performance was by Xavier Owen (batting: 10 for 0## bowling 9 for 2).,Dick,2010-02-11
26,A tougher match against keen opposition ended with a narrow victory. Josh Livingstone and Xavier Owen both gained 2 wickets with excellent tight bowling and Harry Glenister achieved a wicket maiden.In the batting Alex Wills stood out with a splendid 19 for 1 (net 13 runs). Of 6 wickets lost 3 were to runouts and poor communication between the wickets## something to improve on in the future. A good cup win. Onwards!BWCC 36 for 6## Wendover 10 for 9.,Dick,2010-02-11
27,"""Match played on Sun 14th May. Although BWCC lost we were highly praised for our excellent cricket and spirited stand against a very good team by the opposition coach and spectators. Despite facing County bowlers we were unphased and had so many big hits not got to hand it could have been a very different story! Excellent batting performances by all## notably Tom Harrison (14 for 0## net 14)and a confident opening by Rory Seekins in the batting (9 for 0## net 9) as well as the wicket keeping## holding onto a low catch behind the stumps on their first ball.Harry Wells picked up 2 wickets for 11 runs and Jake Cutter the off cutter took a wicket on his first spinny ball! Toby King and Rory also clean bowled 2 batsmen.Communication between the wickets was excellent## in the future we can work on improving our field placement## as despite the Captains instructions fielders crept closer to the wickets and were not always in their optimum position despite clear """"favoured strokes"""" by the batsmen.The side was ably captained by Josh Livingstone## Alex Wills bowled very well (6 for 0)batted very well (10 for 1 net 4) and kept well## Xavier bowled in the very tight way we have come to expect!(3 for 0). Joe Carey and Duncan Healy also added to the team effort with very good all round performances.Very well done all.Chesham 292 for 5## BWCC 260 for 6.""",Dick,2010-02-11
28,Ballinger U13 B's v Beaconsfield15th May 2006On Monday evening## despite heavy threatening skies the U 13B's took on a strong Beaconsfield U13's in a cup game. As has been the case with a number of our fixtures this year we were up against a lot of boys who were a year older## which## at this age makes quite a difference. Beaconsfield batted first and were kept in check by a good opening spell by Jack Hankinson and Luke Hughes. Mid innings acceleration lifted them to a total of 104. The highlight from Ballinger's point of view was a magnificent over from Jack towards the end of the innings which began with a wicket## clean bowled## was followed by two fast dot balls## followed by a wicket and then another wicket as a result of a great one handed catch by Sam King. Jack was now on hat trick and had a good shout for an LBW turned down## to complete a triple wicket maiden. Tom Branigan## in his first outing also bowled well and took two wickets.Ballinger batted against good straight bowling and never## with the exception of James Rose who showed a very good technique## got to grips with the Beaconsfield attack. We were dismissed in the 20th over for 48.The boys and girls need to have the more experience against the hard ball and work hard on their batting. The odds are always going to be a bit against them this season when up against clubs fielding only effectively an 'A' team## but hopefully this will provide good experience and practice for next year when most of the team will still be eligible for U13's cricket.Team: G.

29,Wendover 189 for 10 BWCC 230 for 10.A good win## with very consistent bowling by all## exceptional figures from Harry Wells (4 wickets for 3 runs) against their better batsmen## Robert Rose (2 for 3) Alex Howe (2 for 1) and Joe Carey (2 for 8). Robert and Alex both bowled wicket maidens. Rory Seekins and Jake Cutter bowled excellent spin and were unlucky not to get results. Only 7 extras (14 runs) were conceded.Jamie Wise led the batting with an excellent 19 for 0. Joint 2nd highest scores were Joe and Daniel Cady (both 9 for 0). Everbody scored runs although too many balls were skied (and caught). Luckily some lapses in running between the wickets with the associated poor calling went largely unpunished.The fielding was of a high standard with a fantastic diving catch from Alex Wills in the slips## 2 catches from Rory and 1 from Robert. Euan Jackson was particularly good in the field with a very good eye for the ball. Joe conceded no byes in his 10 overs keeping## Rory only 1.,Dick,2010-02-11
30,<p>Ballinger played High Wycombe on Thursday and just for once the sun shone. Unfortunately this might have been one of those occasions when a downpour might have been a saviour.</p><p> Batting first Ballinger's main hope was not to let their score go below 100 which they just managed by 8 runs. All the team tried their hardest## especially first timer Charlie Rodwell## but they were no match for Wycombe's accurate bowling.</p><p> The Waggoners then has to try and limit Wycombe's strong batting line up to under 300. Again they achieved this keeping them to 280. We even took 4 wickets thanks to some smart fielding and good use of the sun.</p><p>Harriot did an excellent job of captaining and the team all worked well together but##we were well and truly trounced by a good Wycombe side and it was with some trepidation that the manager gathered his team around him.

31,The 15s made a sound start to their league campaign against strong local rivals Chesham. Batting first against a side containing several county players BWCC lost an early wicket when Richard Clarke was out LBW before Charlie Wells and Ollie Richards steadied the innings. Charlie was the second out## to another LBW decision## with a useful score of 19## bringing in Tom Crick to join skipper Ollie who## having opened his innings with five singles## began to find the boundary. With Tom scoring exclusively in ones## Ollie pushed the score along well until he was out to a brilliant one-handed catch by Andy Goddard off the talented Ali Birkby for 31. Chesham's joy at dismissing Richards was short-lived## however## when Alex Macdonald struck his first ball for four and his second for six## Birkby's first over gaining a wicket but having gone for 19. Alex had found his timing straight away and raced to 30 in only nine scoring shots before being caught. Nick Rose and James Woods added useful## quick runs as the innings drew to a close with a score of 125## probably a few short## given the dominance enjoyed in the middle of the innings.Chesham's top three were all county players and it was important to bowl tightly early on## which Tom and Alex managed## but it was a change of bowling which gained the first wicket when Andy Goddard## playing for the off-spin## was deceived by a perfectly pitched top-spinner from Fergus Hardy. Jason Rance was then dropped first ball off a difficult low chance to square leg. Tight bowling and athletic fielding kept Chesham below the run rate required as they managed only six boundaries in total. James Woods kept tidily and took a neat stumping off Charlie and Tom Crick came back at the end to pick up two wickets including that of Ali Birkby who top-scored with 40. Chesham finished on 87 never having matched BWCC's run-rate in the face of a good all-round bowlingperformance; Tom and Alex being the pick with 2 for 6 and none for eight respectively## both off four overs. Thomas Maw## Jason Stone## in the outfield## and Jeff Moxom distinguished themselves in a very tidy fielding performance for the first match of the season.,Ian H,2010-02-11
33,<p> Saturdays game was abandoned after we'd fielded for 20+ overs and got very cold and grumpy</p> <p>Fortunately for Nick the bowling analysis won't appear in the stats.</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
35,<p>Amid## steady drizzle we assembled at Flackwell and after a delay we started a reduced length 16 over a side match in what was now steady rain.</p><p>We lost the toss and fielded## a decision that backfired on Flackwell as Jack Hankinson## fresh after bowling a triple wicket maiden with his last over against Beaconsfield bowled the best best spell our team have seen this Spring. His four overs yielded 4 wickets for two runs and he was supported by Freddie Gamble who was economic and took a wicket. Luke Hughes took over from Jack and took a wicket with his first ball## leaving Flackwell at a vunerable 19-6 after 9 overs.</p><p>The ball soon resembled a bar of soap and Flackwell re-grouped well to finish on 49-7 from their 16 overs## almost half their total comprised of extras due largely to the wet ball and terrible conditions.</p><p>After further rain (it never stopped) the Umpires agreed that the game could not continue and as this was the last permitted day to play the match the points were shared. This was a frustration to all of the players however they can be congratulated for sticking at a tough job and playing themselves into a position of strength.</p>Tim Rix,Nigel,2010-02-11
38,On a wet## windy and gloomy evening the match at Aston Clinton went ahead thanks to the home side's willingness to play. Aston won the toss and elected to bat but were almost immediately in trouble when BWCC's opening pair of Richard Clarke and Ollie Richards both struck## to leave the home side on 5 for 4 after three overs## good catches in the gully/point region being taken by Richard Wise and Richard Clarke off his opening partner. Although Aston worked hard to improve their score## the BWCC bowlers## using the conditions well## never let them back into the match. Richard Wise## looking quite at home in the older age group## picking up 2 for 8 off his four overs and Freddie Cooke bowling what turned out to be Aston's last man coming in at No. 8. James Stoddart and Dominic Hutson missed out## having been kept back to complete the allotted overs## as skipper Ollie was unaware that Aston were fielding a depleted side.Aston were always going to have difficulty defending a total of 33 and so it proved## BWCC overtaking their score half-way through the fourth over## as Ollie realised the priority of winning the match as soon as possible in the threatening conditions rather than risk giving more of the team batting time.Great credit went to the younger players## who enabled BWCC to fulfil the fixture (and pick up the league points) with only five U15s and fielded with the athleticism and enthusiasm that## together with their vocal support## is becoming their trademark.,Ian H,2010-02-11
39,The U13A's were beaten by the weather on a miserable sunday morning. Despite the oppostion appearing reluctant to make a start the game finally got under way. BWCC made 19-1 after 6 overs before the rain finally forced a halt to proceedings with Sam Privett not out on 13.<br>The game has been rearranged for Sunday 28th May.,Ian,2010-02-11
40,The U14's came up against a very good Dinton side. The match was played in overcast conditions with rain not far away. BWCC won the toss and decided to bat first - perhaps not the best decision. Within the first 3 overs 4 of the top order were back in the pavillion with 4 runs between them - a disastrous start. James Miller and Jonny Freeman steadied the innings and put some runs on the board. James top scored with 19 runs. Wickets then started to fall regularly as the game progressed. However the U14's managed to bat out the 20 overs## with Chris Coldwell being undefeated on 7. Dinton made short work of the 57 runs required to win losing only 1 wicket due to a good catch by Michael Bryant of the bowling of Jack MacIver. As Dinton progressed towards the target a number of catches were offered but none went to hand.

41,The match was played on a very pleasant sunny evening. BWCC won the toss and asked Winslow to bat. Winslow made a good start but some good bowling by Jack MacIver and Luke Martin soon got among the wickets to peg Winslow back. The turning point for BWCC came when Alex Morgen took 3 wickets in his second over and ended with figures of 3-1-6-4 - well done Alex. As the final overs came## Winslow increased their score as BWCC tried to take the last wicket. BWCC were set a stiff target of 96 to win and sadly lost an early wicket. However Tom Sperring and Luke Martin steadied the innings. When Tom was out for 11## James Miller came to the wicket and the game turned again towards BWCC. Luke and James took BWCC's score to 81 for 2 when Luke was out for a very good 34 and James followed him shortly after for 28 - his first four deliveries being dispatched for 4's. There then followed a flurry of wickets but Jack MacIver used his county experience and held the innings together and hit the winning run to end up 6 not out. BWCC got home with over to spare but it was becoming very tense over the last few overs. All the BWCC team contributed to the win and was well deserved. <p>scores Winslow 95-9 BWCC 96-7 <p>Team:- Tom Sperring## Jeff Moxom## Luke Martin## James Miller## Lewis Ostacchini## Aaron Bailey## Jack MacIver## Alex Morgan## Michael Bryant## Chris Coldwell## Jonny Freeman,Chris,2010-02-11

57,The Waggoners overtook Wendover's score comfortably in the end but it could have been so much more difficult for Ballinger if Wendover had held their catches. This match was played on the artificial wicket at the Witchell ground## Wendover's main ground being out of action because of insurance problems relating to balls being hit onto the by-pass. Batting first## Wendover began steadily## with opener Morley picking up what runs were offered by tight bowling from Alex Macdonald and Ollie Richards. Once the Ballinger quicker bowlers were off they attempted to pick up the scoring rate and## although Charlie Wells kept control## Aaron Bailey and Sam Privett suffered from some heaves. Two went to hand to give Sam two wickets and James Stoddart and Thomas Maw finished the allotted overs tidily## James getting a bit of swing and a wicket. Alex and Ollie finished with one for ten off four overs and one for five off three respectively. Morley batted through the innings to finish on 42 not out## out of a total of 93. </><p>In reply Jeff Moxom and Charlie Wells opened with 20 from five overs before Jeff was out to a smart catch behind the wicket. In came skipper Richards## to be dropped first ball from a none too difficult chance## off a leading edge## at mid-off## and then survive a run-out chance taking a second on the mis-field. They were opportunities Wendover could not afford to miss but they were only the first as every Ballinger batsman survived a chance as the run rate accelerated; Charlie Wells making 16## Ollie a quickfire 18## Alex a brutal not out 31 and James Woods 8 not out. The innings closed as the evening got gloomy in the 14th over. Ballinger are through to the next round of the cup with much credit going to the younger players as only four 15 year olds were available. Lewis Ostacchini and James Miller performed athletically in the field and Aaron## Sam and both James all contributed with ball or behind the stumps.,Ian H,2010-02-11
58,<p>Ballinger notched their fifth win in a row on a glorious sunny evening at Stokenchurch.</p><p>Although this looks a comfortable win on paper in reality it was a different story. To many of the top order fancied their chances against the Stokenchurch bowlers but lack of concentration and application meant early wickets fell cheaply. Richard Wise made double figures then threw his wicket away with a rash shot while Callum Bright## Evan Webster and Jamie Wise batted sensibly to see out the 20 overs and to push the score past 80. The innings was rescued by Luke Martin. Carrying on his good form of late he showed the others how to mix solid defence with attack (4 fours## 1 six) finally being forced to retire having made 33. Fortunately Stokenchurch also gave us 22 runs in extras.</p><p>It was hoped that the Ballinger attack would be too strong for the opposition and so it proved with only 25 runs conceeded off the bat off 20 overs. However## a somtimes sloppy performance in the field cost 25 extras. Adam Robinson bowled well again conceeding just one run off his four overs. Six Stokenchurch batsmen were bowled## three by James Stoddart (Captain for today)## one by Sam Privett and Callum Bright making the most of his opportunity picked up two.

59,Downley 202 - 5 BWCC 204 - 5<p>Ballinger skipper Matt Riley had a great time on Saturday when he led Ballinger to their 1st MBL win of the season.</p> <p>Winning the toss and putting Downley in on a good pitch always looked a difficult decision but good opening spells from Adams & Humphreys calmed his nerves. Sadly Downley's Peacock hadn't read the script and his 120 was one of the best innings seen at Ballinger. 202 looked a useful score but Riley and Branigan gave the Waggoners a solid start## then Mathews and Humphreys helped Riley edge closer to the finish line. Two lusty blows from Adams reduced the asking rate and finally a huge 6 by Riley## in the last over## finished the game in the Waggoners favour.</p><p>A perfectly timed innings of 108no by Riley was the toast of the day ( especialy by those belonging to the God Boycott faith) but once more everyone enjoyed an excellent game of cricket played in the right spirit.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11

With three of the team playing their first hard ball game and others playing their first match of the season the team were no match for a strong Chalfont team.</p><p>Bowling first Ballinger's bowlers did well in that they only concede 18 wides or no balls. Pick of the bowlers was Ed Cousins with 2 wickets and Michael Hinds who bowled two very tidy overs of leg spin. Harriet was her usual economical self## conceding only 1 run in her two overs. Max or Ben Dugdale (give me a clue how to tell them apart) did and excellent job behind the stumps and only 4 byes went past. </p><p>When batting the first 2 pairs## Chris Cooke## Max Dugdale## Charlie Rodwell & Ben Dugdale## were doing really well and had 33 on the board then disaster struck in the 8th over when 3 wickets were lost.

Even skipper Salisbury recognised the chance of some cheap wickets. Aldbury managed just 67 off the bat but chasing their 92 on this pitch always looked a difficult task. Their determination to win was shown in their use of just 3 bowlers.</p> <p>Ballinger's batsmen had to decide whether to go down all guns blazing before they got out to the dreaded shooter or just block.

Then disaster. Paul got one that pitched then shot straight along the ground.</p><p>Out marched Dom Birkby with 6 needed to win off 2 overs.

Ian Macivers figures were 8-5-8-6. This was high quality left arm spin. Humpreys did his job at the other end taking 4-29 and## for once## Ballinger's fielders had their catching hands on.

Batting first the Presidents side reached 204 with only Nick Adams 3-58 and Ian Davies 2-45 making any impression.</p> <p>President skipper Matt Riley used a missing jock strap as an excuse to drop down the order. He then sent his younger brother in to blunt Ballinger's opening attack## in particular Adams. Having made sure the bowlers were tired and the ball soft he made maximum use of an excellent batting track and rattled up a quick 92 (quick being a relative term).</p> <p>The Waggoner's then timed their run chase to perfection. Fallowfield - Smith led the way with an excellent 41. Making sure the Saturday skipper was watching in the hope it might get him moved up the order (buying copious quantities of beer tends to be more effective Fally). Then Jeremy Hunting's first appearance in a helmet at Ballinger obviously helped him as he added a watchful 49 and got Ballinger very close to their target## but with 9 wickets down and Pete Clifford on fire## it needed a skippers innings from Salisbury to guide them home in the last over.<p/><p>It was a great day and it was wonderful too see many people (especially children) watching.

71,Away again! <p>Kingshill batted first and their District openers took full toll on anything short with excellent pulling and hard hitting. One opener retired after reaching 30 and their number 3 continued the strong scoring. Harry Rix at first change took two wickets including opener Charlie Young and the run rate was held in check somewhat by some better bowling by Basty Richards and an inspired spell by James Rose who managed his first ever 5 wicket haul. Well done James!</p><p>Ballinger however did not help their cause in the field with sloppy ground fielding and lack of concentration with field positions. In all around 30 runs were probably given away needlessly and this can make the difference between winning and losing.</p><p>Chasing a challenging 127 we lost an early wicket when Freddie Gamble was run out after a mix up. Thereafter the boys batted sensibly and consolidated their position. Alex Humphrey again batted well and he had good support from Sam King## James Rose and George Kingston.</p> <p>Kingshill bowled well and fielded better and we eventually ran out of overs with our score on 89. So a loss by 28 runs to a team of mainly Year 8's## not a disaster but a match where more concentration on the basics of fielding and good length bowling could have seen a different result.</p>Stick at it boys and girls!Tim,Nigel,2010-02-11
75,<p>Beaconsfield won the toss and decided to bat. In spite of scoring 8 off the first 2 balls Ballinger soon started to put the screw on the opening pair with tight seam bowling. At the end of 4 overs Beaconsfield were 199 having lost 4 wickets. Some great bowling from Tom Edmonds and Matthew Dunnington. The bowling continued to be very tight backed up by some great ground fielding which resulted in a run out. With the combination of spin bowling and genuine pace Beaconsfield found it hard to accumulate runs. They ended on 266 having lost 9 wickets in the process.</p><p> Ballinger started their innings by losing a wicket on the first ball. This just served to get the openers to dig in and progressed to 204 losing another wicket in the process. Will Smith and Andy Rishton had a little trouble in their calling but also managed to add valuable runs taking the score to 217.</p><p> Tom McIntyre and Tom Butterworth came in and showed how runs can be easily accumulated by using the pace of the ball and playing simple cricket shots. They moved the score on to 233.</p> <p>At this point it seemed that if we carried on playing in the same vein we could win.</p><p>Max Maciver and Harry Bartlett did just this inspite of Beaconsfield continuing with their probing bowling and good fielding.</p><p> The last pair of Joe Hankinson and Matthew Dunnington took the responsibility of stearing the team to victory. 266 was passed in the 19th over and then they knew they just had to get 6 runs ahead in case there was a wicket. This they did with confidence.</p><p>We now look forward to playing Winslow Town in the semis.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11

78,Match Summary from last night:Although Chesham were not the strongest opposition they have faced the overall performance by everyone was excellent. I asked them to concentrate this time on not loosing wickets and building a score. Without exception everyone tried to do this and only 2 wickets were lost in the whole innings. Everyone batted well. The wicket was dreadfulEvan & Tom B - Good steady start## good running. Highlight## probably Tom E's lofted drive straight back over the bowlers headMax & Will. - Built on the start## continued to pick up the singles. Highlight - Will stepping slowly down the wicket to every ball in the last over which was OK because he didn't slog it & made sure he got something on it.Tom B & Tom Mc - Batted in a similar fashion to the other night . Nothing stupid## picked up the singles and hit the odd bad ball for 4 four. Highlight - Tom B taking a lifting ball on the helmet.Andrew & Guyan - Both reasonably calm ## good running with Guyan looking to give Andrew more of the strike. One wicket lost - run out. Never run if you cannot see the ball. Highlight - Shot of the day by Andrew## a clip off his legs through mid wicket.Mat & Joe. Much the same as the other night. Probably added about 30 even after loosing one wicket. Joe's was the innings of the day with some terrific off drives.The fielding & bowling was good throughout and wickets fell all the way through. One area of improvement - reduce the extras## especially wides. They also need to make sure that they don't loose their shape in the field as there is a tendency for everyone to slowly creep in.Finally and the most important point of all. The attitude of all the boys towards weaker opposition was fantastic. I received several comments about their conduct on & off the pitch. All were a credit to themselves & the club.,Roger,2010-02-11
79,<p>On an absolutely baking Sunday afternoon## the boys met their toughest opponents yet with the U13 cup quarter final against High Wycombe played at home. Very few of the boys have had an opportunity to play on a real pitch so far## and a full-sized pitch too. </p><p>Ballinger opened the batting with Sam Privett and Stefan Otto## who braved a phenomenal opening spell from the fast High Wycombe bowlers. Luke Martin at 3## batted well## and scored 9 before being bowled. It looked as though we were going to be all out rather quickly## but then we had some solid performances by our mid-order to tail end batsmen## who recovered the situation quickly and impressively. Alex Morgan 8## James Stoddart 9## Richard Wise 11## Dominic Hutson 21## and Tom Sperring 7. This recovery spurred the boys on## and dented High Wycombe's confidence## denying them the last three wickets. </p><p>Dominic 21 not out## Richard Wise 11 caught## Luke Martin & James Stoddart 9 apiece## Alex Morgan 8## Tom Sperring 7 - (and a debate re the contentious runout followed over the next week!). Final Score 68 off the bat + 34 extras = 107 for 7 off 20</p> <p>High Wycombe came in to bat a little less confidently than might have otherwise been the case. James Stoddart opened the bowling with a serious maiden over## followed by really good spells from Luke Martin & Richard Wise as well kept the HW score down to 16 off 5; then 39 off 8 before things started to slip away from them. Despite some good bowling by the boys## and captain Stefan desperately trying to keep one particular batsman on strike## the High Wycombe batsmen 3 & 4 started to really put the runs on and denied the Ballinger bowlers the wickets they so desperately needed. High Wycombe finished on 84 off the bat + 20 extras = 103 for 1 off 16 overs. </p><p>I know the boys were disappointed - but I was pleased with their performance - we were simply outclassed on this occasion. At least they made HW work for hard for their victory. </p>,Ian,2010-02-11

However## despite Jack Thompson bowling Stefan for an unlucky 2## Ballinger upped their game and started to really put the runs on## taking advantage of some sloppy fielding## several wides## and a very fast outfield with a short boundary one side to achieve a magnificent 185 for 5 off 20. (A total of 23 fours & 3 sixes !!)Top scorers: Alex Morgan 37 not out (got to 36 before needed to retire## but with only 1 ball to go## the LH umpire insisted he stay put ….

81,<p>Ballinger batted first again## comfortable that even though they lost the toss## with the breadth of batsmen and bowlers within the squad## they no longer need to work out what score they're chasing## but leave that to the opposition to worry about! </p><p>Alex Morgan and George Bartlett opened the batting facing H&C's top bowler - who proceeded to despatch our first 3 batsmen a little quicker than anticipated## despatching top scalp Luke Martin for 0 . Kristian Otto (batting at 4) came in and proceeded to chalk up some sensible quick singles## a couple of fours and a six. He was as stunned as the H&C wicket-keeper himself to be caught behind after scoring 26 runs and snatching several byes & misfields. Dominic added a further 12 runs off the bat before also being caught behind with an unlucky top edge. The wicket-keeper's 2 minutes of stardom faded quickly as Jack Maciver and Richard Wise both met their targets of batting sensibly and retiring at 30 and 31 respectively - well done lads ! The sudden disappearance of batsmen 6 & 7 caused panic in the Ballinger dressing room as not one but two batsmen were suddenly needed within one run of each other## and someone wasn't ready at all ! Never mind Tom Sperring - you redeemed yourself in the field as usual with your steadfast fielding & excellent concentration. </p><p>Richard Wise 31 retired## Jack Maciver 30 retired## Kristian Otto 26 caught behind## Dominic Hutson 12 caught behind## George Bartlett 11 caught## <br>Final score: 113 off the bat + 32 extras (whoops!) = 145 for 6 off 20</p><p>Jack Maciver opened the bowling## finding excellent line and length## with only one run off the first over## a wicket maiden in his 2nd and only 1 run again off his 3rd over to complete a really good spell.

82,Widmer End 164-10 BWCC 162-10Adams onslaught fails at End<p>Ballinger missed the opportunity of moving into the top half of the table on Saturday when they contrived to lose a game they should have won easily. Widmer End won the toss and elected to bat first. They were soon in trouble at 19-3 with Lloyd in particular causing lots of problems. An excellent innings by Saead enabled Widmer to reach 164 but his dismissal by Davies started a rapid collapse. Davies finished with 5-38. Not a true reflection of how he bowled.</p> <p>Ballinger had 54 overs to score the runs but only Riley and Humphreys played with any conviction and at 121-9 the Waggoners were down and out. In strolled Adams and in 20 balls he completely changed the game. He scored 39 and with 5 overs left the game was in the bag. Unfortunately he tried one heave too many and lost his middle stump leaving the Waggoner 3 runs short of victory.</p> <p>Skipper Riley said that to get so close and not win was very frustrating but until we bat as a team we're not going to win these games.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
83,Monks Risborough 308 -3 BWCC 192-10<p>Ballinger would like to draw a veil over events at the Green on Saturday. </p><p>A combination of injuries## holidays and some football match left the Waggoners with a much weakened team. Monks Risborough took full advantage of this and## batting first## rattled up the first ever 300 score at Ballinger. The wicket was fast and true## the outfield like lightning## the temperature in the 90s and Ballingers bowlers were put to the sword. 308 came up in only 32 overs.</p><p> Ballinger's reply was brilliantly led by Adams who for some time had the Waggoners up with the required rate## but when he was out for 90 the rest of the batting subsided tamely and the Waggoners finished on 192. </p> <p> Injured skipper Matt Riley would like to thank Jack & Max Maciver and Andrew Rishton 12##10 & 11 years old respectively for turning out in place of some senior players and many of the older juniors. Ian Maciver got his wish of playing in the same side as his sons but I don't think he expected it to happen so soon</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
84,BWCC 220-9 Penn St. 141- 10<p>Another blistering hot day at Ballinger saw the Waggoners batsman take full advantage of the conditions. With skipper Salisbury leading the way with 57no##Webster (37) and Camp(39) making useful contributions on there season debuts## Ballinger were able to declare on 220.</p><p> Webster then removed Penn Streets openers## Lloyd produced a good spell of 3-24 and Fallowfield-Smith cleaned up the tale with 3-11. Not a bad effort whilst wearing his pads and gloves. A good all-round fielding display by Ballinger reduced Penn Street to 141 -10</p>The Salisbury machine rumbles on.,Nigel,2010-02-11
85,<p>Ballinger Under 15s Against Ley Hill Under 15s on 16 June 2006</p><p>Ballinger Under 15s produced another excellent performance in beating Ley Hill. Ley Hill batted first but struggled early on against a superb display of pace bowling from Tom Crick who had match figures of 3 wickets for 7 runs off his 4 overs. He was well supported by his fellow bowlers## in particular Fergus Hardy 1 wicket for 5 runs off his 4 overs## Charlie wells 2 wickets for 10 runs off 4 overs and Jason Stone 1 wicket for 5 runs off 2 overs. Ley Hill were dismissed for 75 runs off 19 overs. </p><p>Ballinger made an excellent start in reply with a fine opening partnership of 29 runs from Richard Clarke and Charlie Wells.## The team were brought home by Ollie Richards with 28 not out and James Wood 13 not out. </p><p>A thoroughly professional performance from Ballinger Under 15s. </p>,Ian,2010-02-11
86,The Nick Rose - Ollie Richards combination swept away the top of Winslow's batting order to set up a comfortable win that confirmed Waggoner's place at the top of Conference 3 and earn them a place in the league semi-finals. Batting first after winning the toss Winslow opened with Bishop and the dangerous Callum Price. Tom Crick and Alex Macdonald opened the bowling for Ballinger and made good use of a quick## bouncy pitch but without taking a wicket as they completed their allotted overs. <e><p> With the bowling changes came the wickets however. First Fergus Hardy tempted Price into a lofted drive but “did” him in the flight. Tom Maw judging the catch nicely at mid-on and making it look easier than it was. But it was Ollie Richards charging in from the White Hut End who found the pitch most to his liking. Getting plenty of bounce he had the Winslow batsmen constantly in difficulty on the back-foot and induced four chances behind the wicket where they were gobbled up by Nick Rose. Nick## who has not kept regularly this season## turned in an immaculate performance## not just in taking the chances but in his glove work generally. Ollie finished with 5 wickets for 8 runs from his overs before Charlie Wells and Jason Stone polished off the tail. Charlie taking 2 for 6## aided by a stunning one-handed catch by Jason at slip## and Jason 1 for 1 off one over. The last wicket was a smart run-out by Alex Macdonald who removed the brave H. Bishop## youngest of the Bishop brothers## who had been pressed into service after a late drop-out and offered some late resistance## pulling Wells for a boundary. Winslow finished on 70 all out## probably a few more than they should have got after Ballinger placed some over attacking fields and conceded a few too many extras. <e><p> Ballinger started steadily but Richard Clarke was bowled off an inside edge to bring Ollie Richards in to join Charlie Wells. They progressed steadily until the beginning of the 9th over when Ollie cut lose against the leg-spin of the felicitously named Turns## smashing 18 off 5 balls## before offering a hard caught-and-bowled which was taken. Tom Crick then came in and he didn't hang about either hitting a rapid 9 before Charlie caught the mood and pulled a six to finish the match on the last ball of the tenth over## unbeaten on 21; 34 having come off the last two overs as Waggoners came home on 71 for 2. <e>Ballinger now go into a semi-final against Stokenchurch away.,Ian H,2010-02-11
87,Ballinger won comfortably on a beautiful evening at the picturesque ground on the common but this was only possible because of 6 players from younger age groups who allowed the fixture to go ahead.<e>Batting first Ballinger openers Richard Clarke and Nick Rose opened fairly steadily but## seeking to push the score along## Nick holed out for 13. Ollie Richards## arriving straight from a school game to fill his customary slot at first wicket down## came to the wicket in good form but## hit on the pad sweeping## was adjudged leg before wicket. Ballinger were now in some trouble because## at number 4 while other batsman were en route## was Fergus Hardy## yet to bat this season## a fair striker of the ball but not a batsman guaranteed to occupy the crease. He started with a couple of customary swipes before nailing a powerful straight drive for 4. This seemed to give him confidence and he started to score quickly## some powerfully hit pulls mixed with some genuinely classy drives off the back foot. Meanwhile Richard Clarke was batting confidently## running unselfishly and keeping the score moving and together they took the score past the hundred mark both completing their fifties; Richard for the third time this season and Fergus for his first ever half-century. Jeff Moxom## Jason Stone and the classy James Wood## who had been delayed## added a last flurry of runs to post a total of 150 for 5.,Ian H,2010-02-11
88,<p>A combination of a blistering onslaught by Nick Adams and another brilliant spell of left arm spin by Ian Maciver were just too much for Ley Hill on Saturday.<p/><p>Ballinger won the toss and## for once## decided to bat first. Good opening spells by Ottaway & Peterson had made Ballinger work hard for their runs and a couple of wickets from Helm tightened the screw. The appearance of Adams changed everything. He made his intentions clear when hitting his first ball for six and the mayhem continued in the same vein with him reaching his 50 off 18 balls. This enabled Ballinger to reach 221## which looked a good total on dusty pitch.</p><p>When the Hill batted they were in trouble right from the start when they lost Lown to the 4th ball of their innings. This was the first of Ian Maciver's 5 victims and skipper Riley's decision to open the bowling with him was vindicated with Maciver finishing on 12-9-16-5. With the other bowlers all doing their bit## and the fielders taking the catches## in particular “buckets Riley”## the Hill were hustled out for just 76.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
91,TPCC 151- 10 BWCC 152- 5<p>Ballinger visited Tring Park on Sunday and on another scorching day had to field first. All the bowlers put in good spells with the pick being Dom Birkby with 4-21. Tom Crick bowled really quickly and on another day will get a better reward than the 1 wicket he took. Tring were bowled out for 151.</p><p>In reply Hardy & Riley got the Waggoners off to a steady start but a stand of 90 between Hunting and Riley set the seal on the game. When they were out in quick succession it was left to Jason Stone to guide Ballinger home<p/>,Nigel,2010-02-11
92,<p> For the second time we lose the opportunity to beat a side below us in the league. It doesn't happen when we play Holmer Green</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
93,<p>When Downley gave Ballinger first go on what looked to be a difficult wicket## the visitors were a little concerned. Fortunately for the Waggoners Riley and Humphreys were in imperious form. Their opening partnership of 80 gave the innings substance## which## with the help of a well paced innings by Kerry was enough to get the Waggoners to 183- 9.</p><p>Downley were then treated to a master class in spin bowling. Fergus Hardy took 6-42 in 12 overs of high quality off spin. His line and length were immaculate and none of the Downley batsmen were comfortable against him. Aided by some excellent catching## including 1 brilliant effort by Ballinger's new keeper Davies## Ballinger's bowlers hustled Downley out for 133. This gave Ballinger a much needed 25 points.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
94,H&C 275-5 BWCC 195-5<p>Ballinger played host to a Sri Lanka B side on Saturday and the difference in class showed. There was a lot at stake on this game and Sri Lanka made the strange choice of batting first. Their openers put on a 100 with Gunasekara scoring an immaculate 85 and the strangely named Pritchet 57. The loss of Gunasekara to an excellent catch by keeper Fallowfield- Smith didn't slow Sri Lanka's progress as his replacement Daluwata scored 29 at more than a run a ball. In the meantime## Pritchett had been removed by Davies## and Sri Lanka's Rifai had been quietly scoring an excellent 64. Sri Lanka declared on 275-5 off 39 overs.</p><p>When the Waggoners batted Sri Lanka opened up with their 2 spinners Daluwatta & Dias and had immediate success when skipper Riley was bowled first ball of the innings.Branigan also went early but Sri Lanka's spinners## nor their change bowlers Rifai and Gunasekara## were able to remove McIntrye. He batted resolutely for his 98no and was helped by Davies (39) and Kerry to secure the draw. Ballinger ended on 195-5. This was the first completed game that Sri Lanka B have failed to win this year and their decision to bat first may cost them the title.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
95,BWCC 180-6 30 overs The Lee 106-9 30 overs<p>Ballinger played the Lee on Sunday. The weather was pretty awful and this efected the way the match was played. Having started a normal time match a long interruption forced the skippers to decide to change it to a 30 over game. Ballinger were batting at the time and a rapid change in tactics was required. First Fallowfield-Smith(24) and then Davies (54no) went on the charge but it was the 76 added by Davies and Macdonald that enabled the Waggoners to set The Lee the difficult target of 180.</p><p>Crick and Macdonald make a formidable opening attack and they soon removed the openers with just 19 on the board. Then a fine spell of 3-5 in 4 overs by Stone ripped the heart out of the Lee innings. Guy Morgan did his best for the visitors with 21 and his son Alex## a Ballinger junior## was 13no at the end.</p><p>Sadly it was obvious from the 15th over when the Lee needed 130 at nearly 9 an over that the game was over and there was nothing left to play for. As it happens the Waggoners were unable to take the last wicket and the Lee ended on 106-9. An honourable draw in a time game - a stuffing in an overs match</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
96,BWCC 232 - 8 Long Marston 122-10<p>On a beautiful day Long Marston is lovely place to play cricket. The ground nestles in site of Ivinghoe Beacon in the vale of Aylesbury.</p><p>Skipper Jamie Kellock took full advantage of winning the toss and his batsmen didn't let him down. Openers Humphreys & Hunting gave the side a good start and then Kellock and Davies put Long Marston's bowlers to the sword. Kellock went past 50 for the 3rd time this season his innings ending on 74 when he missed another swipe to cow corner. Davies was even more ruthless scoring 36 of his 45 in boundaries.</p><p>Unfortunately no record was kept of partnerships so there is no way of knowing if Kellock and Davies set one.</p><p>The Waggoners bowlers were far to good for Long Marston and with Hardy to the fore they soon bowled LM out for 122. Fergus took 6-11 in 11 overs of high quality off spin.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
97,BWCC 130-10 v Knotty Green 131-9 29th July<p>Ballinger were inserted by Knotty Green on Saturday. The Waggoners were reasonably happy with this as the pitch looked like it would deteriorate and with a team full of spinners they were always going to be in with a chance.</p><p>Riley and Humphreys got Ballinger off to a steady start with 39 off 15 overs. Then there was a dramatic collapse with Davies## Fallowfield-smith and Adams out in 6 balls. Adams was obviously suffering from oxygen deficiency at the rarified hights of 4 in the order. Maciver(16) and Crick(31) added some sanity to the situation with stands of 31& 37 with Riley & Kerry. Kerry was slightly disgruntled to find himself below both Adams and Fally and to add insult he was then fingered by Maunsell - His first time.At 120- 8 Hardy recognised the importance of the situation and swiped his first ball straight in the air.</p> <p>130 -10 was always going to be difficult to defend but Ballinger set about the job with great determination. Another excellent spell from Maciver kept the Green batsmen under pressure and then a fantastic 12 over stint from Adams (5-18) reduced Green to 117 -8 in 38th over. Sadly the 39th produced 14 lucky runs and the game had slipped away.</p><p>Ballinger have to learn how to win these games if they want to compete at the top end of the league rather than trying to stave off relegation.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
98,BWCC 222 - 8 v Weekenders 144-1030th JulyA second wicket stand of 104 was the corner stone of Ballingers big total. With Richards(73) making a rare visit and Kellock(50) on a roll The Waggoners soon reached 222-8.Once more Hardy's spin was the key to bowling the Weekenders out His 3-27 and 2 each for Birkby & Humphreys was too much for the opposition and they were all out for 144 in 35 overs.,Nigel,2010-02-11
99,<p. This may be one of Ballinger' more fortuitous abandonments as playing Holmer Green with with a side full of kids didn't bode well. 8pts was probably a good result.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
100,Widmer 119-10 BWCC 120 - 4<p>Ballinger played Widmer End on Saturday and registered a useful win. Widmer elected to bat first and were soon in trouble when Lloyd bowled their opener in the second over. Unfortunately for the Waggoners this only brought Ali Hashmi to the crease earlier than they would have liked. Hashmi proceeded to smash 90 out of 105 in just 21 overs. It was fantastic to watch unless you were a Ballinger bowler. He was finally out to a brilliant catch by Maciver. Sadly for Widmer## Nick Adams was back to his best and was running through the rest of the Widmer batsmen. He finished with 6-29 and The End were all out for 119.</p><p> The side recognised that they were missing skipper Riley as this was an ideal situation for him## 63 overs to score 120. As it was Ballingers batsmen made hard work of scoring the runs with only Fallowfield-Smith(33no) looking comfortable. Davies survived a VERY close LBW decision to help Fally add 40 for the 5th wicket. Hashmi & Collins bowled well for Widmer but 119 was always going to be difficult to defend and the Waggoners earned their 25points in the 27th over </p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
101,BWCC 194-10 Lt. Gadd 109 - 10<p>Ballinger had another good win on Sunday when they beat Little Gaddesden . Batting first the Waggoners reached 194 thanks mainly to an excellent knock of 75 from Andy Branigan. Second highest scorer was extras with 45.</p> <p> An excellent opening spell from Michael Senior(3-24) soon had the Gadd in trouble and with Hardy( 3-11) bowling another top spell they were never in the hunt. 12 year old Jack Maciver finished them off with 3 wickets for 2 runs in 2 overs- all clean bowled. Little Gaddesden finished on 109.</p> <p> It's worth mentioning that only 3 players in the team were over 30 and boy did they look old</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
102,On a beautiful evening at Stokenchurch the 15s played their best cricket of the year to comprehensively defeat a strong Stokenchurch side. Batting first the Waggoners openers of Richard Clarke and James Wood started brightly but both were soon caught behind by Lovegrove off of Duffy - Ballinger 17 for 2 off four overs. This brought together Ollie Richards and Alex Macdonald: when they were parted## eleven overs later## the score stood at 117## the Stokenchurch bowlers having been dispatched to all parts of the irregular-shaped boundary. Ollie departed having scored 58## including eight fours and one six## in a display of power and technique. After Ollie departed## Alex increased the tempo of his scoring so that 56 were scored in the last five overs## Alex finishing on 80 not out## Tom Crick and Tom Maw batting with great maturity to ensure he had most of the strike. BWCC 174 - 4 in 20 overs. <e><p> As well as Ballinger had batted## their bowling display was even better. Alex Macdonald## showing no signs of tiredness## and Tom Crick## working up good pace## opened the bowling and## at the end of their spells## Stokenchurch were 31 - 5 (all bowled) off 7 overs and the contest was over. Richards## Hardy and Stone kept the pressure on the middle order and James Stoddart## with two wickets## and Freddie Cooke## with one## finished the innings off. 76 all out from 16 overs and a Ballinger win by 99 runs. A storming performance by Ballinger and one that should give them much confidence for the final.,Ian H,2010-02-11
103,Ballinger Waggoners under-15s have retained their Bucks County League title## defeating North Crawley by 31 runs in the final played at Ballinger.<e><p>On a cold day## with overcast conditions and a green pitch## Ballinger won the toss and## sticking to plan A## elected to bat first. After 7 overs of tight opening bowling by Crawley## with Ballinger restricted to 11 for 1## it looked as though skipper Ollie Richards had made the wrong decision. However the solution was in his own hands as he strode to the wicket at number 3. Refusing to panic## he played himself in before putting the innings back on course.<e> <p>Beginning with some trademark drives## Ollie added 37 with Richard Clarke before being joined by Alex Macdonald who## typically## went on the offensive from his first ball. The pair added 79 before Alex was out for a 22-ball 32 attempting to add to his six boundaries. Ollie Richards was now totally dominant and## when he was well caught on the long-on boundary by Monty Stoyles off the first ball of the last over## he had scored 80 off 54 balls## an outstandingly mature innings. Fergus Hardy with a towering six and James Wood## slashing a four through square cover added another valuable 12 runs before Ballinger's innings closed at 138 - 5 off 20 overs; 47 coming off the last 4.<e><p>Ballinger's opening bowlers Tom Crick and Alex Macdonald now made use of the favourable bowling conditions in Crawley's innings and broke through in the fourth over when county batsman Alex Walker drove Alex Macdonald powerfully## but in the air## to Ollie Richards who held on to the chance. The key to the match was how the Crawley batsmen handled the Ballinger spin bowlers and## when they were introduced at 30 - 1 from 8 overs## the match was in the balance. Spin duo Fergus Hardy and Charlie Wells have gained plenty of experience in these situations however and## backed up by athletic fielding and tidy wicket-keeping from Nick Rose## maintained the pressure exerted by the opening bowlers. The powerful Simon Myatt was smartly run out by Tom Crick attempting a quick single and now Crawley were in trouble at 37-2## their two most dangerous batsmen back in the pavilion## off 10 overs.<e> <p>Ballinger resisted Crawley's attempts to match the run-rate## with another brilliant run-out by James Stoddart## and brave efforts in the deep by Tom Maw and Jason Stone## injured catching Crawley captain Matt Hodges on the boundary off Fergus Hardy and replaced by Jeff Moxom## exemplifying the teamwork. Ollie Richards bowled top-scoring Matt Goss for 37 and## despite a few late boundaries## Crawley finished on 107 -5 off their 20 overs## 31 runs behind.<e><p>So Ballinger retained the title they won last year## perhaps a more noteworthy achievement in that the playing squad was not as large this year and contributions were made throughout the season by younger players## including James Wood## James Stoddart and Jeff Moxom## who all featured in the final but also players from the under 14## under 13## under 12 and under 11 teams who enabled us to field a full team in some of the difficult matches early in the season. The squad will be rewarded by the prize of a trip to Lords for a specialist coaching session and a tour of the world famous ground.,Ian H,2010-02-11
104,BWCC 87 v Monks Risborough 91-8<p>Saturday had a real end of season feel to it and Ballinger played like the season had already finished. Having convinced themselves that the pitch was going to play badly Ballinger's batsmen were none to pleased when their skipper lost the toss again and the Waggoners had to bat first. They then contrived to get out in as many bizarre ways as possible with only Alex Macdonald(27) and Davies (40) showing any idea. The Waggoners were all out for 87.</p><p>Monks Risborough looked in no trouble until Hardy## tripping over his own feet## contrived to run out one their openers with a brilliant throw. The Waggoners were then frustrated by some wild slogging by Monk's early order but wickets kept falling and Adams was on fire again. Another 3 wickets from him dragged Ballinger into the game and suddenly they had a chance. Kerry took a steepling catch off Hardy to remove Monks dangerous Hussein and then Davies brilliant stumped Rafiq off Hardy but with 8 down one more wild slog clinched for the home side.</p><p>Ballinger's cause may have been helped if they'd had a full team. Having only 9 batsmen didn't help one bit</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
106,Amersham Hill 136-10 v BWCC 137- 4Sunday 6th August<p>Ballinger had a comfortable win against Amersham Hill on Sunday. When Hill batted first## skipper Kellock was able to give all 8 of his bowlers a go. Once again Hardy was to the fore with 3-19 closely followed by Lloyd(3-9) and Birkby(2-12). Thus Hill were bowled out for 136. For Ballinger Tivey(64no) and Webster(67) put on 133 for the 3rd wicket which ended the game as a contest but Webster's dismissal did enable Tom McNeil to secure his second first ball dismissal of the weekend.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11

115,Missenden Misfits 109 for 10 (28 overs)Ballinger Wagonners 107 for 10 (33 overs).Again BWCC are let down by their batting after a good performance in the field. After early pressure from the opening bowlers## Humphries(3wkts) and McNeil(1wkt)## wickets begin to fall. The openers were ably supported by Hutson(1wkt)## Stone(1wkt) and Stoddart(3wkts). Misfits captain produced a well controlled half century. After an early tea wickets began to tumble## Hunting(can't pull## shouldn't try) skyed one off the top edge## Kellock was beaten by an in-swinger which cut away just enough to beat the outside edge and take the top of off stump. There can be no excuses for Paul(I'm not talking to you) Humphries who was out pulling at shoulder height to a short delivery that bounced twice before rolling onto off stump. Tom Maw played very well for 25 but the highlight of the batting was a fine final wicket stand between Hutson and Stoddart who brought us to within 2 runs of victory.,Jamie,2010-02-11

132,One of those matches where## as umpire## you are tired out from trudging from square leg to put the bails back on. Oddly a close game where the boys felt they had such an easy target to reach that their heads were not foccussed on the job in hand and some felt slogging was all that was reqd. A lesson learnt I hope. Elliot Brooks guarded his wicket perfectly under pressure from their best bowlers in the last few overs. Due to scoring abberations had he lost a wicket the match could have been lost. Fielding positioning still needs improvement (often too close and wrongly positioned). Best bowling: Fennell 2 for 3## Thomas 6 for 2## Bentley 8 for 2 and Howe 11 for 2. Best batting: Fennell 14 for 1## King 11 for 1. Someone achieved 2 for 3## which was very exiting if he was bowling## unfortunately he was batting!!!,Dick,2010-02-11
133,Despite leaving it as late as possible before finally calling the fixture off## it was always going to be in doubt. 1 point each.,Ian H,2010-02-11
134,A tough match against 3 county bowlers. Having peaked at the dizzy height of 218 for 4## after 14 overs a collapse ensued. Best bowling Thomas 9 for 2## Bentley 2 for 1 and Brooks 7 for 1. Batting best: Cuthbert 5 for 0. Nevertheless a good match taht all enjoyed apart from Brooks and Martin who were the wrong end of Cheshams Freddie Owens hatrick.,Dick,2010-02-11
135,A very good start to the season with some sharp fielding and good defending of the wicket## only 1 wicket lost to a the thinnest of edges for a wicketkeeper catch. Best bowling came from Max Bailey (5 for 2) and Eddie Bentley (5 for 1). Best batting: John Martin (16)##Eddie Bentley (14)and Alex Howe (11),Dick,2010-02-11
136,A tight match in a beautiful setting with what looked a perfect track## but which turned out to be very spongy## such that the ball consistently stayed very low## making batting difficult (straight bat is the answer). Monty Cuthbert captained the team very well managing the field placing and anticipating well with good bowling selection to get the best out of the surface (spinners bowling in to the less bouncy end). Toby King also kept wicket very well. Best batting was John Martin 11f0##King 6f0##Brooks 4f0.In bowling Will Reid (9f1) and Alex Howe (11f2)are to be congratulated for switching to spin (which matched the pitch## relatively new to both of them## but success in practice was emulated on the pitch today). Alex narrowly missed his hatrick. Lots of good bowling## in particular: Matthew Fennell (11f3## all wickets in one over)and Eddie Bentley 3f2## including a maiden in the 3 overs). Brandon Plumb achieved 6f1 and Monty 7f1. Claudio Bassano was agressive as always in his bowling and batting##including a wicket maiden. Fielding was generally good with 2 runouts and 3 catches## including an excellent difficult midfield catch by Eddie Bentley.Well done by all## in particular John Martin who not only top scored but guarded his wicket very well.,Dick,2010-02-11

139,Longwick 161 for 10 (32.5 overs) Ballinger 165 for 6 (36.2 overs)On a hot Sunday afternoon Ballinger travelled to Longwick with the youngest team it has put out all season. Apart from three adults the Juniors ranged from 17 - 11.Ballinger won the toss and decided to field first in a 40 over game. All of the 7 bowlers used took wickets## with 2 each for Humphreys## Hutson and Stone and one apiece for McNeil## Martin## Kellock (yes we were that short on bowling!!) and Hankinson.Longwick were eventually dismissed for 161 in the 32 over.In reply Ballinger lost Clarke early on for a duck## but Mason (31) and Kellock (32) put on 70 for the second wicket before Mason was caught and Kellock was controversially given out stumped. This bought the 11 year old Will Smith to the crease who batted with maturity beyond his years. Wickets began to drop in clusters with the score not getting going## and it was left to Tom McNeil and Luke Martin to provide the entertainment for the day## by smashing the bowling to all parts of longwick.Victory was achieved in the 36 over with Tom not out on 26 and Luke not out on 35 including three big sixes.The game was enjoyed by all## and played in the right spirit throughout. Congratulations must go to all the juniors who performed exceptionally and are a credit to the junior section.Man of the Match - Luke Martin for his 35no. Combined good defence with attacking instinct and produced the shots of the day when he cover drove the opening bowler for two fours in a row.,Jamie,2010-02-11
141,<p>Chesham B won the toss and elected to bat first. They started very quickly with former Ballinger Waggoner Alex Morgan hitting 46 runs. Then our bowlers found their length and line and they restricted Chesham to 104-5. Tom Sperring took 3 wickets thanks to a great catch by Jack Hankinson and 2 in the deep by James Miller. Nigel's fielding session the previous evening proving fruitful.</p><p>When BWCC started we lost a couple of quick wickets but kept up with the run rate. A good partnership between Luke Martin and Jeff Moxom saw us reach 55-3 after 10 overs. Sadly## once Luke was out for 40## with 2 sixes and 6 fours## the innings lost momentum. All the remaining batsman contributed runs but no-one was able to stay around long enough to see us home. The team were un-done by Chesham's spinners and could not cope with their accuracy and length.</p><p>Again extras were a contributory factor## we conceeded 22 (13 wides) against their 8. We must improve this area of the game. This was a much better performance than the last match - well done to all.</P><p><b>Batting:</b> Martin 40## Miller 9</P><p><b>Bowling:</b> Sperring 3-13## Hankinson 1-12## Bailey 1-12</P>,Chris,2010-02-11
142,Ballinger 211 for 6 (44 overs)## Aldbury 100 for 10 (32.4 overs). Ballinger made the most of the good weather in their fixture against the Albury Entertainers on Sunday posting a competitive total of 211 for 6. It was Richard Clarke who (aged only 16) stole the show for Ballinger batting unbeaten the whole way through the innings scoring a elegant 99## leaving him just one run short of his maiden century.Ballinger's youth were no less competent in the field with James Stoddart (aged 14)## Luke Martin (aged 14)## Tom McNeil (17) all claiming wickets. But it was Rhodri Webster## still only 19 himself## who polished off Aldbury taking 4 wickets and 4 catches as there were bowled out for 100.,Jamie,2010-02-11
143,A good win## top scorers Brandon Plumb (11f0)## Eddie Bentley (9f0)Alex Howe scored 15 for 1 wicket. Max Bailey led the bowling with 5f1 off 3 overs with Tom Ryland's 1st appearance with 5f0. Will Reid achieved 7 for 1 and Mike Thomas bowled 2 tidy overs of spin (3f0). The fielding was satisfactory although controling a team and ensuring fielders are in the right position is not as easy as it seems as our rotating captains are finding out...,Dick,2010-02-11
144,MBL Premier DivDownley 115 -10 v BWCC 117 -7<p>Ballinger managed to dodge the showers on Saturday to record a much needed win over Downley</p><p>Winning the toss skipper Riley put Downley in on what looked a difficult wicket to bat on. He guessed correctly as the slow pitch made runs hard to come by. First Adams and Lloyd bowled with their usual miserly economy and took 2 wickets each## then spinners Hardy and Davies finished the job off with Hardy recording the excellent figures of 4-16.</p> <p>The Waggoners set off in pursuit of Downleys 115 with a certain amount caution with Riley batting 40 overs for his 49. Adams gave the innings some impetus with 21 off 8 balls then Lloyd and Maciver saw the visitors home - but only just - as the players walked off the field the heavens opened.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
145,BWCC v Scuttlers Scuttlers 221-7 BWCC 120-9<p>On Sunday Ballinger played host to a very strong ScuttlersX1. Following an excellent lunch the Waggoners were forced to chase leather for the next 2 hours as the Scuttlers rattled up 211.</p> <p>Ballinger openers Webster and Hughes did a great job in putting on 67 for the 1st wicket but after Will Hunting removed them both in successive overs and then Waggoner's danger man Hunting 2 overs later the writing was on the wall.</p><p> The introduction of the Scuttler spin king Kerry saw the wheels fall off completely as a combination of his guile and some stunning fielding reduced the Waggoners to 9 down## but skipper Salisbury## and last man Tom Graham## managed to hang on for an honourable draw. </p> A very pleasant day,Nigel,2010-02-11
146,An evening that started sunny got rapidly gloomy as a poor batting display by Ballinger amassed a total of only 71. Fortunately it was also getting literally gloomy and the rain when it came was torrential ending any hopes of a result and ensuring the points were shared.,Ian H,2010-02-11
148,<p>Ballinger won the toss and elected to bat first. Openers Joe Hankinson and Dom Hutson had to face 2 of 3 County bowlers in the Amersham side and they saw off 6 overs from the opening bowlers. However runs were hard to come by and Joe was bowled for 6 by the first change bowler. A partnership between Dom and Joe Stevens of 25 upped the scoring rate until Joe and Dom were out in quick succession. This brought together James Miller and Jeff Moxom who then batted out the remaining 8 overs## putting on 47 un-beaten runs. The Amersham bowlers all kept good line and length and made Ballinger work hard for their runs. Whilst 95-3 looked a reasonable score we felt that another 15-20 runs would have made it more difficult for Amersham.</p><p>When Amersham started their innings## Joe Hankinson and James Stoddart opened the bowling and kept the run rate under control and each took a wicket to remove both openers after 6 overs. Aaron Bailey and Tom Sperring then came on to bowl and Tom got a wicket in his first over. However Amersham started to up their scoring rate even though Tom Sperring took two more wickets and ended his spell with excellent figures of 4-1-3-14## the second match running Tom has taken 3 wickets in a innings. Unfortunately the our bowlers could not exert the required control on runs from both ends and some loose bowling allowed Amersham to reach their target in the 16th over for the loss of 5 wickets.</p><p>This was a competetant display against a team containing 3 County players. The team fielded well and took all the catches offered. The boys should feel proud of their performance against goo opposition.</P><p><b>Batting:</b> Miller 26 no## Moxom 16 no## Hutson 19## Stevens 12</P><p><b>Bowling:</b> Sperring 3-14## Joe Hankinson 1-7## Stoddart 1-18</P>,Chris,2010-02-11
149,Haddenham 100-10 BWCC 101-6<p>Ballinger managed to sneak in another win in amongst Saturday's thunder storms. Playing bottom of the table Haddenham meant this was a must win game for the Waggoners.</p> <p>Skipper Riley did his job by winning the toss and inserting the visitors. A brilliant catch by McIntyre should have set the standard for the Ballinger fielders - sadly not. Fortunately the Haddenham batsmen gave them plenty of practice. Davies took 5-20 in an a spell that Mr Bassett would have recognised## a brilliant run out by Hardy and the return of Adams saw the end of The Haddenham's innings for 100.</p><p>The Waggoners were reduced to 30-4 by some interesting umpiring. A stand of 60 between Kerry & Birby(21no) steadied the ark and Ballinger eased home with 15 overs to spare </p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
151,Beaten## by a vocal## determined and very good bowling side. Ignoring wickets we scored 70 runs## they scored 65. Its nice to dream. Our bowling was also tight which restricted their run flow. Fielding too from both sides was generally sharp,Dick,2010-02-11

Fergus Hardy and Dom Birkby added another 30 precious runs at the end so Ballinger reached the relative safety of 165-10.</p><p>The Monks went about the task of chasing Ballinger's total in their normal flamboyant style but Birkby was on top form with ball and his spell of 3-23 kept the visitors under control. A brilliant reflex catch by Whelan had removed danger man Shah and with Hardy( 4-46) weaving his magic The Monks were bowled out for 115.

He reduced Ballinger to 19-7 and it looked as though it was all over for the Waggoners.

Sebastian Richards then weaved his spell taking 2-17 off 7 overs. A couple of wickets for Luke Hughes and 1 from Tim Rix finished the innings off.Derek Richards and Will Smith started the innings well but Ballinger found run scoring no easier than the visitors and at tea the Waggoners had struggled to 45 - 5. After tea the flashing blade of Rix senior soon made short work of the deficit and 10 man Ballinger were home with 30 overs to spare.Highlights of the day were abrilliant catch by O'Kelly off Thompson to record the first ever wicket for the 2s and a brilliant runout by Tim Rix## managing to hit the 1 stump he had to aim at.,Nigel,2010-02-11

212,Ballinger Under 15s gave agood account of themselves against a strong Bovingdon team narrowly losing in the penultimate over. Ballinger batted first and made a steady 96 for 7 off 20 overs. The highlight of the batting was the impressive batting of Jack Maciver 29 and Max Maciver 20. Their excellent batting was well supported by the running and intelligent batting by James Rose who scored 11 and George Kingston who scored 8.Bovingdon in reply batted excellently and scored 98 for the loss of 3 wickets.Ballinger## however## bowled well and the pick of the bowlers who maintained a good line and length were Sebastian Richards with 2 wickets for 9 runs off 4 overs## Harry Rix 1 wicket for 18 off 3 overs## J.Rose 0 for 18 off 3 overs and an excellent opening spell from Jack Maciver 0 for 10 runs off 3 overs and Jack Hankinson 0 for 10 runs off 4 overs.,Derek,2010-02-11

Haddenham then dug in and their 5th wicket partnership proved vital as stand in skipper Rix's bowling changes failed to click.</p><p> With Basty tying down one end a return from Thompson did the trick with a wicket and a slowing of the scoring rate. The remaining Haddenham opener was unmovable and carried his bat for a hard worked 95 not out## Haddenham finishing on 194-8.</p><p>Ballinger lost the early wicket of Michael Bryant (2 bounces or more?) but Petrie and Richard O'Kelley moved the score on well. Paul Branigan batted sensibly after O'Kelley was dismissed with Petrie playing the senior role. </p> <p>After Branigan was out Paul Rose kept Petrie company and any result was still on however with Rose's dismissal and the loss of 3 quick wickets meant that only a winning draw was really possible.</p> <p>This was achieved emphatically with Petrie scoring at will and never looking in trouble.

Unfortunately Bastie struggled with the wind and was hit out of the attack by Hill's Phillips.</P><p>Meanwhile Andy Thompson was putting in a top spell with 3-51 off his 12 overs. He removed danger man Phillps and then was helped by a brilliant catch by Sperring and another top delivery to remove the Hill's middle order</P>.Hill's skipper Bell## meanwhile## was moving serenly on to an excellent 79 no. A couple of late wickets including one from new man Nick Howe gave the Waggoners another bowling point</P> Ley Hill finished on 265.<p> Balinger were surprised that the visitors had batted their full quota of overs but by setting the Waggoners the tough task of reaching 236 for the winning draw it made sense. </P>. <p>Unfortunately the Hill hadn't allowed for Richard O'Kelly who batted brilliantly on what was still an excellent track. Not wanting to take too many singles Richard put the fast out field to good use by scoring 20 fours## throw in a couple of 6s and you soon get to the 107 he scored.</p> <p> Without any of the regular openers available skipper Kerry was press-ganged into opening.After a few scratchy moments early on## especially against the excellent Asquith## Kerry soon settled down to help O'Kelly move the score along. By the 30th over the pair had reduced the asking rate to 7 an over## which was easily achievable on this pitch. Unfortunately Richard perished going for one more big hit and with the fielders all on the boundary it was now going to be difficult to win the game. Kerry kept going but with 5 overs to go he to went for the wrong shot and was caught on the boundary for an excellent 97. This left 40 to score off the last 5 over for the win but only 10 for the winnin draw. Sounds easy but 3 quick wickets put the Hill back in the game. A nerveless Alex Howe then led the Waggoners to 236 they needed for the winning draw and managed to hang on with Tom Sperring to frustrate the visitors.</P><p>Another really enjoyable match played in an excellent spirit,Nigel,2010-02-11
230,Ballinger Under 15s completed a comfortable win against a competitive Amersham Hill side.Ballinger## captained by Sebastian Richards## won the toss and scored 106 off their 20 overs. The highlight of the batting were the performances of Chris Cooper with 19 and Mathew Rose with 22. Chris Cooper showed that he is developing into a fine attacking batsman. The performance of Mathew Rose particularly caught the eye with a stylish 22 before being unluckily run out. Mathew is clearly going to develop into a fine number 4 batsman.Amersham Hill in reply reached 83 for the loss of 9 wickets.The opening attack of Jack Hankinson and Tom Sperring was too strong for the opposition who were reduced to 7 runs for 5 wickets. Jack Hankinson's bowling figures of 5 wickets for 6 runs off 4 overs again showed that he is fast becoming a top bowler at this level## well supported by Tom Sperring who returned 1 wicket off 3 overs## bowling into the sun.Tidy performances from the remaining bowlers## Sebastian Richards## George Bailey## Harry Rix## George Kingston and Luke Hughes ensured a comfortable win.Finally well done to Jack Bull who kept particularly well looking into the sun. Jack is a fine prospect for the future and already looks comfortable keeping wicket at this level.,Derek,2010-02-11
231,BWCC 379 - 3 Chenies 237 - 10For the first time we were able to field a full strength side but## unfortunately## it was against pretty weak opposition. Chenies were no match for the strength of the Dugdales and the style of Xavier and 400 looked on the cards at 1 stage. The same applied when Chenies batted with accurate bowling from Xavier and the rest of the team keeping them down to 237.</p>Chenies did their best but with the majority of their team only 10 it was always going to be a tough task for them.</p><p>Sadly this was the last league game of the season and although we finished 2nd in the league I don't feel that we didn't reach our full potential.</P> <p> Hopefully the boys will take advantage of summer coaching and the winter programme that is now being put together</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
232,Ballinger batted first. Everyone batted sensibly against some good bowling. Only 5 wickets lost## two of which were silly run-outs## Poor calling and bat running-in being the culprits. Monty and George top-scored on 8 - both playing good looking shots. Hamish kept his average up## contributing 7. The final score was 258.In the field## the team showed the usual resilience and commitment in adversity. There was consistently good fielding and backing up although catching opportunities were not taken. Good inexpensive bowling from Ollie NM## Matt OK## Ollie C## who have all tightened up their line and length - well coached## Roger. George's very economical 2 overs for 2 runs and a wicket was not quite good enough to earn him man of the match## which went to Will G for an outstanding 3 for 7. I also awarded Monty a batting Man of Match for his fine come-back (from injury) top score.Although the gap was quite large## really the difference between the sides was one player who tonked some reasonable bowling around the ground## including a 6. Saif## who captains the U10 County team## scored 38 with some crafty harvesting of the strike - this took the game away from Ballinger.Overall## a mixed season with some good wins and a few losses but a pleasure to manage a highly spirited and commited U11B team## whom I am sure will form a great U11A team next Summer.,Simon,2010-02-11
233,Cadmore 147 - 10 BWCC 137 - 10Skipper Kerry won the toss again and was happy to insert the opposition on a pitch that was difficult to tell from the outfield.</p><p> Cadmore End is a difficult place to bowl especially when the strip is at the very top of the square. Anything short normally ends up in the cemetary and Saturday was no exception. It took openers Tim Rix and Andy Thompson 4 overs to find their range by which time Cadmore had scored 50</p> <p> Once they'd settled down things moved back in the Waggoners favour. With Rix taking 3 - 37 and Peter Petrie ( 4-16) amongst the wickets again it looked as though the visitors were going to remove the End for about 100. An annoying 7th wicket stand of 40 took the home sides score to 141 then Ballinger let 2 youngsters add anothe 6 runs. How important would these be in what was likely to be a tight game</p><p> Along side the senior bowlers Rob Rose had bowled a tidy spell of off-spin and Jake Cutter a couple of excellent overs of leg-spin.</P> <p> Only 32 overs were used to bowl the home side out so Ballinger set off in pursuit of their target with quiet determination.</p><p. Will Smith (26)## Peter Petrie and Andy Thompson added 49 for the 1st 2 wickets. Then Jack Bull batted well for his 26 but the rest of the middle order collapsed. When Jack was out Ballinger still needed 55 to win but still had 19 overs to score them in. Could the tail end manage it.</P><p> Skipper Kerry did his best aided by first Jake Cutter with a stand of 19 then with Evan Webster with a stand of 20 but when Kerry fell with the score on 130## with still 10 overs to go## his frustration was obvious.</p><p> Rob Rose and Evan added another 7 when a suicidal run ended the Waggoners innings on 137.</P><p> The 6 runs given to Cadmore last pair## too many byes and 8 dropped catches all contrived to make Ballingers task harder. Add a dodgy LBW and an unlikely catch to remove 2 top batters and you have some excuses for this loss</P><p> Positives were Jack Bull's and Evan Webster's batting and Rob Rose and Jake Cutters bowling</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
234,Ballinger Under 15s lost off the last ball in an exciting match against Ley Hill.Ley Hill batting first were restricted by some fine bowling to a score of 85 all out off 20 overs.All the bowlers contributed which was particularly pleasing## namely Jack Maciver with 1 for 17 off 3 overs## Jack Hankinson 2 for 13 off 4 overs##Sebastian Richards 2 for 10 off 4 overs## Tom Sperring 1 for 12 off 4 overs## George Kingston 2 for 16 off 3 overs and Harry Rix with 1 for 8 off 2 overs.In reply Ballinger made 82 runs for the loss of 8 wickets. The highlight of the batting was the fine innings of 33 runs from Will Smith. Unfortunately none of the remaining batsmen made double figures. A flurry from Jack Hankinson and George Kingston at the end which yielded 13 runs from the last over almost saw us home but in the end we were undone by the failure to capitalise on Will's fine innings.,Derek,2010-02-11
236,An understrength Ballinger Under 15s lost an exciting match in the last over against Hawridge and Cholesbury.Ballinger batting first made 107 runs for the loss of 3 wickets. The highlights of the batting was the partnership of 95 runs between Will Smith who scored his maiden 50 for the club abd Jack Hankinson who was dismissed for 37. Will Smith## in particular has developed into a fine opening batsman and is particularly strong off his back foot.Jack Hankinson## in turn## has matured into a fine batsman at this level and has the ability to develop into a fine stroke player.Hawridge and Cholesbury in return made 109 for the loss of 7 wickets## principally due to an opening partnership of 62. Once this partnership had been broken Ballinger tore into the remaining batsmen taking 6 wickets for the next 37 runs.The pick of the bowlers were Max Maciver with an excellent spinning display which yielded 5 wickets for 13 runs off his 4 overs. Tom Sperring bowled extremely well taking 1 wicket for 6 runs off 4 overs.The failure to break the opening partnership was however to prove fatal and in the end Ballinger were just unable to pull off what would have been a great comeback in the circumstances.,Derek,2010-02-11

249,Potten End 235-5 BWCC 175-6On another belter of a wicket at Ballinger the Waggoners bowlers lacked the control to keep the Potten End batsman in check.<p/><p> With ball swinging around in the humid atmosphere Ballinger's youngsters found it difficult to find the right line. It wasn't until Peter Petrie was introduced into the attack did skipper Kerry finally get some control.Peter's 5 over spell 2-9 followed by an excellent spell of 7-0-32-0 from Jake Cutter meant one end was being tied down. Unfortunately runs were coming at 7+ an over at the over end.</p><p>Jack Hankinson's second spell was much better than his first with just 14 runs coming off this 5 overs<p/><p> Potten suprisingly batted there full 45 overs when an early decleration might have given them more chance to bowl out theyoung Balinger side<p/><p> Peter Petrie also starred with the bat scoring an excellent 61. He was well supported first by Jack Hankinson(21) and then by the injured Ben Carlin (22).<p/><p> Ben had damaged his knee whilst fielding which meant he was only able to bowl 5 overs and had to bat with a runner. He was also run out in slightly odd circumstances. He was at the strikers end and having played a shot the non-striker called his runner through for a single. The fielder launched the ball at the 'keeper and Ben had to take evasive action. The keeper removed the bails in his attempt to run out the non- striker but recognised that he was probably in and was somewhat surprised to find the batsman had been given out.

Two quick wickets## one thanks to a great catch behind by Paul Branigan## and some slow scoring gave encouragement but a determined 3rd wicket partnership helped The Lee steady their ship and they started to score more quickly.</p><p>Bowling changes did not really do the trick but a great catch by James Rose at mid off got us back into things and a T. Rix caught and bowled helped. However## it seemed that every poor ball was punished and The Lee's number 4 rode his luck and accelerated## scoring a good 91 supported by various partners## so much so that 110 came off the last 15 overs as The Lee reached a competitive 212-8 off their 45 overs.</p><p>A steady reply was what was required and despite losing opener James Stoddart early on Derek Richards & Paul Rose batted sensibly to add 70 for the 2nd wicket. Paul was hampered by another muscle pull (when will he learn to warm up?) necessitating a runner but the good news was that the run rate picked up with James as runner! Derek was out for a well crafted and elegant 38 thereafter Rose and Paul Branigan kept up the good work. When Rose was out for an excellent 47 the run rate was down to just under 6 an over. Tom B departed despite looking good and another 80 was needed off 14 overs. Branigan senior hit well before being caught behind for a timely 44. After which Tim Rix and James Rose nurdled a few and ran as fast as possible keeping the run rate manageable.</P>When James was caught at point young Ian Stoddart came to the crease but was treated cruelly by Rix who demanded quick singles and quick 3's when young Ian would have rather dealt in 4's## so much so that Ian became the 2nd batter with a pulled calf!</P><p> A winning draw was passed and when the 38th over yielded a vital 15 runs we were almost there. A casual flick for 4 from Thompson confirmed the win with 5 balls to spare## Rix the older not out on 37.</P>Overall a very good result - and after the collective batting failure of the Dad's at Cadmore End the threat of further disciplinary action from Skipper Kerry could be lifted. However the win was tighter than it needed to be due to too many long hops and another batch of shelled catches. We don't half make life hard for ourselves - but a win is a win and it was a good game of cricket.</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
259,I wonder if the weather Gods are on our side. A match against the top side and another against our least favoured opponents rained off on consecutive w/es. <p>Come on chaps you can do it</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
260,<p> Hooray - A dry day at last## even though the pitch was very damp and the outfield in front of the pavilion positively swampy. Inserted by Haddenham## our batsmen made slow progress against tight bowling - unsurprising## given the conditions. With commendable application## Paul Humphreys(27)## Richard O'Kelly(unluckily run out for an impressive 20 on his 1st Team debut)## and Fally with a very solid 35##kept the scoreboard ticking over## but with the overs running out Ian Davies ( 24) forced the pace## while wickets fell at the other end. A final total of 145-8 didn't look too great## but the wicket was drying out... </p><p> Ian Davies## skippering## decided not to waste a new ball## and entrusted the old one to his spinners## Ian Maciver and Fergus Hardy. An inspired decision## as it turned out## with the Haddenham batsmen all at sea from the very start. Sharing the wickets## as Haddenham tumbled to a miserable 53 all out## Ian took 5-34## and a severely hung over Fergus amazed us (and himself ?)with5-14. </p><p> A really good team performance## and an enjoyable game played in the right spirit. Brilliant !!! </p><p> Ian and the team would like to thank the ground staff for making sure the match was playable</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
261,The 2s had to cool their heels again this w/e when Haddenham had to scratch. 25 points is good news but skipper Kerry needs to bowl a few more overs to ensure he stays at the top of the bowling averages.,Nigel,2010-02-11
264,For the second week running the 2s had to miss a game because the opposition couldn't raise a team. That's 4 weeks on the trot without a match.</p> <p>Not sure where that will leave us re promotion but it might mean we're in with a shout.</p> <p>Our last game is against top of the table Ley Hill who were playing Cadmore End this w/e.At the moment the Hill are 21 points ahead of us and if they beat Cadmore we can all relax. If by some strange event they lost then next weeks game could be important. Lets hope the weather doesn't interfere</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
267,BWCC 76 -9 Ley Hill 79 -2<p>The excitement of getting so close to promotion was too much for the 2s on Saturday.<p/>The numbers were simple## we had to get 25 points and stop the Hill getting 8.The opposition very kindly put us into bat so now it was up to us. We knew the wcket was going to be interesting and with a very slow outfield it was difficult to decide what a winning total would be. Unfortunatley trying to decide was as far as we got. With only Kerry and Thompson getting into double figures Ballingers total of 76 was never going to be enough.Paul Rose being take off to hospital with 2 broken bones in his hand didn't help matters## but the Waggoners had no answer to Thompsons leg-spin and were bowled out in just the 31st over.<p/><p> Ley Hill's batters took a much more positive approach than Ballinger's had and were soon punishing any lose deliveries. Andy Thompson bowled his usual economic spell and was rewarded with 1 of the 2 wickets to fall. Kerry took the other as a C&B. <p/>.<p> The Hill were home and dry in just the 21st over and were desereved winners of this match and the league title<p/><p> It's been a really enjoyable first season and I would like to thank all those who took part. In particular Jon Bryant who has managed to umpire most of the matches. It makes a huge difference to have someone in the white coat each week.<p/> <p>Now we must go away and start plotting next seasons campaign<p/>,Nigel,2010-02-11
268,BWCC 251 -3 Knotty Green 139-10At last Ballinger managed to put together a top batting and bowling performance on the same day</p><p> Put into bat by 2nd place Knotty Green the Waggoners batters knew they had to perform to avoid the spectre of relegation. With his season spoilt by injury skipper Riley was please to help Rollo McIntyre put on 35 for the 2nd wicket but with Riley's departure the real fun began. Joined by Ian Davies the 3rd wicket pair put on 194 in only 27 overs. With McIntyre 106no and Davies out for 98 Ballinger finished on 251-3<p/><p> Now that the Ballinger bowlers had a decent total to work with could they take advantage? The Green batters were moving serenely toward their target until the introduction of Fergus Hardy. Hardy proceeded to produce a master class in off-spin bowling. By the time he had finished his spell (12.4.41.5) he had removed the Greens top 4 batsmen and with Phil Lloyd (9.2.24.1) providing a tight grip at the other end## reduced The Green to 118-6. Jack Maciver continued his fine run in 1s with another 2 wickets## Davies grabbed 1 wicket and Hardy finished a perfect day by running out The Green's last man which left the visitors on 139<p/><p> An excellent alround performance to finish the league season on and the curry afterwards tasted that much better<p/>,Nigel,2010-02-11
269,"""<p> A glorious sunny day - and the Iconoclasts arrived with only 8 players!

310,A brave young Ballinger team took on the experienced Amersham U11's last night in a League and Cup double-header. Amersham batted first and knocked up a creditable 170-3 with the help of 57 extras! Highlights of our fielding were a great catch by Freddie Sanders from Archie's bowling. Finn Hynes bowled out one of their openers for 1 run## with Max Firth also getting a wicket. Our lads batted out the full 20 overs but were kept to a low score by a tight Amersham field. Lots of work to do. Better luck next time lads!,Nigel,2010-02-11
311,<p> Having won the toss## Waddesdon elected to bat## perhaps unwisely## but not all of their players had turned up on time. (A lesson to be learned ?) Against a tight opening attack of Tom Graham and Nick Adams their progress was painfully slow## and the pressure was maintained when Rollo McIntyre and Ian Maciver took over. Wickets fell steadily## and Waddesdon only reached a total of 87 in 39 overs. Had butterfingers Ballinger not dropped half a dozen catches## their innings would have been even shorter. Best figures went to Nick (4-23) and Ian (4-25)##but Rollo's 1-13 in 9 overs was remarkable## in that he seldom gets a bowl! </p><p> Facing a less than daunting task## Ballinger quickly lost Jamie Kellock## but thereafter Paul Humphreys (40*) and Rollo (42*) cruised to victory in a mere 24 overs.</p><p> Maximum points for the second week running## but doubtless much tougher times lie ahead.... </p>,Nigel,2010-02-11

314,<p>Sunny & warm## good-looking track## win toss = bat first. Which is exactly what skipper Ian Maciver did. Unfortunately the in-form Paul Humphreys was run out just as he was getting going## but in came the equally in-form Rollo to join Jamie K## and proceeded to blitz the Widmer End attack as he raced to a superb ton. First Jamie (29) and then Andy Thompson (18) lent support## then 2 wickets fell at 187## but Alex Macdonald (36*) and Jack Maciver (27*) took us to a useful total of 238-5.

315,Ballinger 244 - 5Chesham 235 - 7Ballinger just pipped Chesham in a really exciting game last night.Ballinger batted first and the opening pair of Jack Peck and Max Firth did a good job until the last 2 balls of the innings when both were out. The next 2 pairs (Jamie Fulcher and Jamie Kingston## Harry Livingstone and Taylor Levitt) moved Ballinger back to over 200. Then Rob Farquhar and Angus DS batted and ran between the wickets really well to put on 20 in their 4 overs. The final pair of skipper Tom Petrie and will Arnold added gloss to the innings with a classy 17.Ballinger then bowled and fielded very well including a couple of good catches. But Chesham kept going and with 3 overs to go they had sneaked 10 runs in front. On came the skipper to ake a vial hat-trick. Another tight over from Max Firth meant Chesham needed 10 off the last over. A 4 of Will Arnolds first ball## followed by a single meant they were within a boundary of Ballinger's score then Will produced a'jaffa' to put the game beyound Chesham's reach. A very enjoyable game played in excellent spirit,Nigel,2010-02-11
316,<p>Finally## we play one of our older fixtures in glorious weather after 4 years of being rained off! What a game it was## too! A wonderful advertisement for timed games## rather than limited overs. At the start of the last over any one of three results was possible.</p> <p> Bourne End won the toss and elected to bat## scoring 216-4. They were assisted early on by some dropped catches and ordinary BWCC bowling. However## Ian Maciver (1-10 off 5 overs)## with assistance form Jack Hankinson (2-45) and Jack Maciver applied some brakes## and B/End declared their innings after 36 overs##leaving BWCC with what turned out to be 41 overs to reach this target. </p><p> James Wood(16) Phillip Doyle(17)and Jeremy Hunting(27) had good starts## and at 70-1 BWCC looked in good shape. Two wickets in two overs slowed the run rate temporarily.</p><p> Enter Fergus Hardy and Will Smith. A stand of 62 was the key partnership of the innings## with Will giving Fergus most of the strike. Fergus made his highest score (and first 50) in senior cricket(56)## hitting cleanly and very responsibly. However## both were out in quick succession. 14 overs left and 6 runs an over needed.</p><p> Enter Jack Maciver(29) - again- batting sensibly and not panicking despite losing two more partners and bringing the total needed down to 24 off 4 overs before he was dismissed. Eight wickets down! This dismissal brought Sebastian Richards in to join Ian Maciver.18 runs needed off 3 ## then 15 off 2 overs.

317,<p> For the second week running BWCC won the toss on a perfect sunny day## and decided to bat on what looked a good Ley Hill wicket. Skipper Matt Riley## back from injury## and Paul Humphreys gave us a bright enough start## putting on 29 for the first wicket in 7 overs. Then the rot set in. Against tight bowling and fielding## our batsmen were tied down## and wickets fell with monotonous regularity. Dogged knocks by Andy Thompson (28 off 65 balls) and Jack Maciver(26)kept the scoreboard ticking## but the last 5 wickets went down for only 28 runs## to leave us with a measly total of 126## and gifting Ley Hill 6 extra overs. </p><p> In reply## both Ley Hill openers were dismissed with only 22 on the board - an excellent start for BWCC - but then the catches started to go down - yet again! - and Ley Hill were cruising towards victory with 66 on the board off only 15 overs. At which point the dangerous and experienced Rennard was clean bowled by an exuberant Phil Lloyd. This seemed to induce panic among the following batsmen## and with top-scorer Peterson superbly caught by Ian Maciver 4 runs later## the remaining Ley Hill wickets tumbled in the space of 7 overs## to leave BWCC## amazingly## winners by 22 runs. Star bowlers were Andy Thompson with 4-20## and Phil Lloyd 4-32. Nick Tegg took 3 catches behind the stumps in only his 2nd gamefor the Firsts## and there were smart catches by Matt## and Charlie Wells.

318,<p>Ballinger arrived at the largest ground around## at Taplow## on a sunny day with the youngest team put out for a long time. Things got tougher before the first ball was bowled## when our keeper/opening bat failed to turn up. Not a good start!</p><p> Skipper Salisbury won the toss## and asked Taplow to bat first on one of the best tracks around. When both openers were removed with only 19 on the board## thanks to Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson## the three Ballinger seniors wondered if it was going to be our day. Oh how wrong they were.The next batsmen added 219 runs before normal service was resumed## and wickets started to fall. Taplow eventually finished their innings on 262-8## the wickets being shared between Adams## Jack Hankinson## Richards## Humphreys## Cutter and Matt Rose.</p><p> Ballinger's openers Humphreys and Joe Hankinson started the reply## and put on 99 before Joe was bowled by Taplow's first team captain and opening bowler for 8 in an hour and 15 mins.Joe batted beyond his years##and was a valuable ally to Humphreys who was sending the ball to all parts of the ground. Wickets fell at regular intervals## and Humphreys went on to score 133 before he was bowled attempting a pull shot to a ball that rolled along the ground. The remaining batsmen hung around for more than 15 overs## before Richards received an unplayable delivery## giving victory to Taplow by 90 runs with only 9 balls of the game left.</p><p> All the juniors performed exceptionally## and are a credit to the Club's Junior Section. They stuck to a hard task in the field## and played the game in excellent fashion.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11

324,Braddenham 175 - 7 42 OversBWCC 164-9 43 Overs<p> It was a beautiful afternoon at Ballinger but skiper Kerry was concerned about his 11th man. When he won the toss## which appears almost inevitable these days## was he to field first whilst 1 man short or take the corinthian attitude and bat first on what looked like an excellent track? Could he trust his young bowling attack to stand up and be counted?</P><p>As usual he took the negative approach and elected to field</p><p>Opening with Tom Sperring and Evan Webster the young Waggoners attack soon got into their stride and with Webster swinging the new ball prodigious amounts and Sperring bowling a tight line they kept the Braddenham batsmen in check</p>Alex Howe and Matt Rose continued the job then Rob Rose settled into a 10 over spell where he took 2-47. Bastie Richards was his usual economic self with 1-15 off 7 and Jake Cutter finished the job by taking the wicket of the visitors danger man.</P><p>Ballinger's fielding and bowling was excellent all afternoon and forced Braddenham to declare at 175 - 7</P><p>Last minute substitute## Derek Richards opened the batting with Peter Petrie and they both looked in good 'nick' sadly Peter was undone by an inswinger and Matt Rose followed next ball to a 'jaffa'. Paul Rose## with his new bat## helped Derek add over 40 for the 4th wicket. Then Derek's 1st innings of the season ended with an inglorious swipe but in the mean time he had given the team an excellent platform with his 49 (jug avoidance). Tom Sperring fell to a good catch and Evan Webster## after looking in no trouble## also fell to a wild swipe.The skipper and Bastie then added 50 for the 8th wicket bringing the Waggoners within 13 runs of victory## but with 5 balls left Nigel became a member of the swipers club and left 4 balls for the last 2 batsmen to survive.<p/><p> At this point parental (Sara) and sibling ( Matt) influence came into play and instead of listening to the instructions from his skipper Rob Rose decided that family ties were more important so ' going for it' was the order of the day. Consequently he became the 2nd member of the Rose family to be out 1st ball.</p><p>Fortunately his dismissal meant that Bastie ended on strike and was able to see out the last 3 balls</p> <p>The average age of the bowling attack was 14 and the skipper was able and happy to let the boys do their job. All the boys need to do now is recognise that batting against adults isn't that hard then we can all rest easy. </p><p>We should have won but it was an excellent game enjoyed by all.</p> <p>Finally## as the skipper tries to learn how to walk again## a plea. Please can all the 'keepers in the club not be away on the same day</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11

331,<p>An unknown opposition## a large ground and a good looking track greeted us at Aylesbury on Saturday and after a win the week before we were keen to add more points.</P><p>Batting first a mix up resulted in debutant Ian Hardy being run out## a real shame. Jack Bull got a start but was then out for 11 leaving us at 12-2 and needing consolidation. A good partnership then developed between Petrie and Rix (Snr)## watchfully to start with but then scoring more quickly to the point that after 31 overs we have reached 130. Rix (54) departed and thereafter## instead of building a competitive total## we capitulated in fairly spectacular fashion## all out for 148 in 40.1 overs##</p><p> Petrie making a fine 51 but a total that was looked very much on the light side.</P.<p>Quick wickets were required and with openers Tom Sperring and Harry Rix bowling well they both obliged with a wicket apiece and at 15-2 there was every chance that we could force our way back into the match.</p><p> Sadly a combination of some hard## adventurous hitting## a pitch that seemed to get better as the afternoon wore on and too many bad balls meant that our total was overhauled quickly with Aylesbury winning by 7 wickets.</p>T<p>he positives were some decent fielding and a competitive opening attack but these positives did not make up for some poor stroke decisions and at least 2 bad balls an over. </p><p>With that in mind we must learn to be more ruthless## more consistent and a little more positive with our batting.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
332,<p>After a successful first season in the league we wanted to start this term with a win against Prestwood to maintain our development. We fielded a very young (and old) side## with 9 under 16's and no one between the ages of 17-46!</P><p>Losing the toss and being inserted was not what we would have chosen and at 10-2 after 10 overs it was clear that someone was going to have to play an anchor innings. Step forward Peter Petrie! Peter batted for the majority of our innings## giving no chances and crafting a well judged 72. It was the backbone of our total as it grew to a very respectable 196-9.</p><p>Importantly we also batted our full 45 overs with every batsman contributing around Peter. First Rix (snr) hit a quick 47 before needlessly holing out at long on## then James Rose hit some powerful blows (before needlessly holing out….). Enter Bastie - promoted up the order and boy did he take his chance## hitting a very assured 30 in the partnership that took our total from slightly wobbly to very acceptable.</p><p>Time for tea - thanks Veronica! And to plan our attack on the Prestwood batters</P>.Spoilt for choice with up to 10 bowlers to pick from stand in skipper Rix opted for Ben Carlin and Jack Hankinson to open. After two overs and at 2-2 it was the dream start## a wicket apiece## one thanks to a great catch at square leg by Robert Rose it couldn't get much better could it? In fact it did## with Hankinson taking 3 wickets with some great controlled bowling - late in duckers that the Prestwood batsman just couldn't handle.</p><p> Carlin picked up another and it was time for a change. Evan Webster and Bastie took over and we didn't have to wait long for results. Evan was in-swinging the ball a good 4 inches a time which combined with a good length meant that he was a real handful. At the other end Bastie soon settled into a repetitive groove tempting the Prestwood lower order and giving little away.</p><p> Wickets fell quickly and after 20 overs the match was won## Prestwood limited to 61 all out and a very impressive winning margin of 135 runs for the 2's.</p>Special mention must go to Jack Hankinson (3-15) for getting us off to a great start## Evan Webster - also 3-15 for keeping the first change very tight and to Bastie (2-11) and Ben Carlin (2-20). Important mentions too to Robert Rose for two excellent catches and to Jack Bull who kept wicket well despite a swinging ball and little carry.</p>The recent rule changes also helped. As well as the 25 points for the win we added 3 points for providing an umpire and 1 for a scorer - many thanks to Derek and Roger for umpiring and to Dave Carlin for scoring (job for life there Dave) - those points might well come in very handy.<p>Well done everyone## an excellent performance by the boys## one that the Prestwood players were quick to congratulate us on. Keep it up!”</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
335,Dylan Shellard led his team to a very close defeat at the common last night. After a tight bowling display keeping Wendover down to 119 runs## with Dylan taking 2 wickets## Waggoners looked favourites to win## until a late collapse saw them end up 32 runs short.

337,<p> The Waggoners 2ndX1 returned to winning ways on Saturday with a comfortable win over Haddenham</p><p> Hadenham won the toss and decided to make first use of what was likely to be a slow pitch - it had been under water on Tuesday. Unfortunately they came up against 1st team super star Phil LLoyd making a forced appearance for the 2s.He immediately removed one opener and bowled an intial 6 over spell of 2-9</P>. This was very fortunate for skipper Richards because at the other end first Tom Sperring ( 1-27) and then Ben Carlin(2-37) decided to test the middle of the pitch. This was much to the liking of the visiting batsmen and reguar excursions were made into the carpark and neighbouring gardens. Fortunately they both sorted themselves out and bowled decent spells.Evan Webster( 1-19) started as the others but adjusted his length quickly.</p>The two spinners Rob Rose (2-42)and Sebastian Richards (1 -28) struggled with their line and length on the slow pitch before Lloyd returned to finish the Haddenham innings on 168.</p><p> Skipper Richards opened Ballingers innings with Will Smith and##following a sumptious drive and an easy single from Will## Derek decided to leave his first ball - fatally. Kim Hughes went in the next over which brought in-form Peter Petrie to the wicket. After a couple of exploritory swishes Peter set about the Haddenham bowling with relish. In 18 overs he and Will added 109 of which Peter scored an excellent 51.Will(82*)continued on serenely and with help from Paul Brannigan and Ben Carlin guided the Waggoners home to a comfortable win in only the 29th over.</p><p>This was a very mature knock from Will and bodes well for his future</p><p>It was a beautiful afternoon at Ballinger## an enjoyable game played in an excellent spirit## a fantastic tea provided by Heidi and a couple of pints to finish with. What more could we ask for.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
338,<p> A perfect sunny day greeted BWCC on their first ever visit to Ibstone's attractive ground. The wicket looked to be a good one## but when Ibstone won the toss and bowled first## Ballinger's batsmen were definitely uncomfortable. A combination of low bounce and accurate bowing meant a run-rate of barely one per over after 14 overs## and both our openers gone.Paul Humphreys and Ian Davies steadied the ship## but with the score on 44 Paul was unluckily bowled## then Rollo went first ball - LBW## one of several apparently harsh decisions. Jack Maciver too perished LBW## and at 61-5 in the 25th over## things were looking distinctly unpromising. However## Ian Davies## back after a 5 week break (in the middle of the season## Ian ? ) was growing in confidence## and with solid support from Jamie Kellock took the score to 143 before Jamie was bowled. Enter Ian Maciver ! Apparently having been inspired by 20/20 heroics elsewhere## he proceeded to smash the Ibstone spinners to all parts## including three 6's off consecutive balls. Ian D finished with a superlative 82*## with Ian M on 41*## and the final score 197-6 - quite an achievement.</p><p> Unfortunately## BWCC's bowling and fielding was not in the same class as Ibstone's## with the praiseworthy exception of Jack Maciver## whose two 5 over spells yielded figures of 5-25.. Several fine catches were held## notably two in the deep by Tom Graham## but other## easier## ones went begging.A stand of 97 for the Ibstone 4th wicket left Ballinger facing defeat with the score on 165-4 with only 31 overs gone. Then the batting started to wobble## and Ballinger sniffed a possible upset.With luck it could have happened## but for another dropped catch## and the odd misfield. It was not to be## though## and the tension was over when Ibstoe sneaked home by 2 wickets off the first ball of the last over of the match## to their great delight## as it was their first win in the MBL Premier Division. </p><p> This was an excellent game of cricket## played in the right spirit by both sides.

339,"""<p> Choosing to bat first against Monks Risborough on a pitch that might (or might not) have been affected by a little overnight rain## with a good deal of cloud cover around## could be deemed a risky gamble. At 30 for 5## the gamble looked a dead loser ! Mark you## at least 30-5 was an improvement on 8 for 3## but even so## Ballinger's batsmen were proving themselves inadequate against a pacy accurate attack which was extracting a degree of lift that they were obviously unused to. Then Monks started spilling catches## and a gritty revival was set in motion by Ian """"lucky x 3"""" Davies## partnered first by Alex Macdonald## then Andy Thompson. From 87-7## when Andy went## the remaining batsmen steadily improved the scoreboard## with Macivers## father and son## giving Davies excellent support. When Davies was 9th out with a valiant 43## with the score on 121## a rather inadequate total looked on the cards. Messrs Lloyd and Adams had other ideas## and their last-wicket partnership added 40 invaluable runs befor Nick was bowled for 26. </p><p> Given Monks' batting feats against us in the past## the match still looked more likely to be lost than won. However## a combination of fine bowling## especially by Adams## (almost) faultless catching (and when was that last written about Ballinger?)## and some irresponsible slogging by Monks' batsmen when they had all the time in the world to win the match## gave Ballinger the impetus to achieve a 70 run victory in a mere 21 overs. Especially noteworthy were catches by Alex Macdonald and Andy Thompson## plus a stumping by Ian Davies (standing back!). Nick finished with 7 for 47 -after two wicketless matches## it's good to report that the great man is on fire again!! </p><p> The pints at the Old Swan afterwards tasted particularly good - now for the league leaders Knotty Green next week.... </p>""",Nigel,2010-02-11

341,Frieth 194 - 9 45 overs BWCC 194- 10 40 oversThis is a difficult game to write a sensible report about.</p>Frieth won the toss and chose to bat.</p>Skipper Kerry couldn't believe his luck and with 1st teamer Tom Graham opening the bowling he was quietly confident that tea would be taken early. Unfortunately he hadn't allowed for the vagories of village cricket which meant only 10 players were on view for Ballinger and that Frieth had a batter who had no regard for reputations.</p><p> Once Tom Sperring had woken up and found the right place to bowl he produced an excellent spell ( 5 overs 3 for 10). Harry Rix followed with 3 -26 and with the two spinners Bastie Richards( 1-44) and Tom Branigan (1 -48)doing their bit it was only the the top man who got a pasting(1 -57).</p><p> Ballinger's reply was led by Richard O'Kelly who looked like a man on a mission. His opening partnership with Derek Richards(21) set the tone. Tim Rix( 15) added momentum and Paul Brannigan(46) helped Richard add 65 for the 3rd wicket. With 160 on the board Richard finally fell but with 8 overs left he should have felt his job was done. Unfortunately Tom Sperring fell in the same over followed swiftly by Bastie Richards both first ball. Paul and Tom Graham then put Ballinger within 8 runs of victory but their skipper didn't do his bit and was out with 5 required. Tom then decided that with 2 required he would shoulder arms to a straight ball. Tom Brannigan sneaked a single off the last ball of the penultimate over. 1 to win## Harry Rix on strike## a wild swipe## middle stump out of the ground and victory had been stolen from us</P>Ties shoul be exciting but when you have lost a game you should have won it's difficult to accept. Still it was fun and a lovely place to play cricket</P> <p> It appears that having 12 on Wednesday is no longer a guide to how many may be playing on Saturday. Therefore Nigel has decided to pick 15 for every game on the basis that he might have 10 by match day</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
342,<p> Another toss won## and we elected to bat against top of the league Knotty Green - though had skipper Riley arrived in time## he apparently would have decided otherwise. With the scoreboard showing 33-2 after 20 overs## and having departed for a duck himself## he was doubtless cursing his deputy. However## Knotty Green's opening bowler Widdowson had figures at this stage of 10 overs##7 maidens##6 runs## 1 wicket## and the normally free-scoring Rollo managed one (iffy) scoring shot in the first 47 balls he faced. Paul Humphreys showed what could be done## and had scored 25 of the total of 31 when he was bowled## but in-form Ian Davies was equally shackled for a while. Then a sudden spate of boundaries loosened the bowlers' grip. Rollo started to hit out## with enterprising support in particular from Andy Thompson (29) and Ian Maciver (again !! - 22 off 12 balls). Rollo's 55 was a fine knock in the circumstances## and the final total of 191-9 showed## for the second week running## the value of Ballinger's in-depth batting. </p><p> Knotty Green got off to a rapid start## but were three down for 32 in only the 8th over## with Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson among the wickets. There followed a hard hitting stand of 59 for the 4th wicket## and clouds## both imaginary and real threatened Ballinger## as thunder rolled around the ground## and lightning lit up the sky.The rain started## and for a moment it seemed the weather might win## but the elements relented## and once the main partnership was broken## Knotty Green's under-strength side showed little resistance in the face of Phil Lloyd (4-39) and Ian Maciver(3-18)</p>< A very satisfying win.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
343,<p>BWCC 218-9 Bledlow 188 AO</p><p>Ballinger hosted Bledlow on Sunday and after winning the toss elected to bat first. Humphreys and Draper opened but were kept in check by a tight opening spell by both Bledlow bowlers. Humphreys soon departed for 8 and was quickly followed by Kellock who was run out after a 'mix up' with Draper## leaving the score at a precarious 11-2. This meant Will Smith came to the crease and batted beyond his years frustrating the opposition bowlers and dispatching any bad balls. In the meantime Draper was steadily compiling runs and these two put together an excellent stand of 105 for the third wicket which ended only when Smith was caught for 41. Useful contributions were then added from Max Maciver and Jeremy Hunting who both supported Draper## who eventually fell for a patient 94. Will Rawlinson (23*) and Bastie (12) added some late lusty blows as Ballinger closed on 218-9.</p><p>With 218 to defend## Ballinger had to bowl well and openers Tom Graham and Jack Hankinson did just that by restricting Bledlow to 46-6 with Graham taking 5-28 off 9 overs. The bowlers were also backed up with some excellent fielding with Paul Humphreys## Tom Maw## Max Maciver and Will Smith all taking fine catches. At this stage Ballinger looked on top## but Bledlow's 7th wicket pair had other ideas as they added 101 which got them back into the match## this was however until Jack Hankinson bowled Downes for 65. One more wicket for Hankinson (3-45 off 11 overs) and a run out later the game was wrapped up for a good 30 run victory.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
344,As everyone knows life is simply a metaphor for cricket. Cricket in April is rarely as wonderful as this.

349,<p>BWCC 152 AO Gaddesdon Row 153-8</p><p>After Penn Street's cancellation## Gaddesdon Row stepped in to fill the fixture on what looked like a very green pitch. Having lost the toss Ballinger were somewhat unexpectedly asked to bat first but it soon became apparent that runs would be hard to come by.</p><p>With Rick Brockett going early## Will Smith and Paul Humphreys consolidated well adding 54 for the 2nd wicket## but both run and over rate were painfully slow. When Will went for 30## no other batsmen showed the necessary patience on an uneven wicket to stay with Humphreys as GR held most of their catches (8 in total). In the end Ballinger were bowled out for 152 in 39 overs in just under 3 hours. Paul Humphreys and extras were the other major scorers with 53 and 38 respectively.</p><p>With only 152 to defend Ballinger had to bowl well again and both Jack Hankinson and Dom Birkby had the GR openers in trouble straight away. Dom took the first wicket after a high catch from Tom Maw and at 47-5 Ballinger looked in control## with Birkby taking a further 2 wickets## Humphreys taking 1 and George Kingston taking a good caught and bowled. Only Flynn troubled the scorers by edging his way to 25. However this brought O' Sullivan and Tyne together who both survived a couple of close LBW shouts early on. They put on 59 and suddenly GR were back in the match; however when Humphreys claimed the wicket of O' Sullivan## Tyne and J Woof soon followed leaving a tight finish in prospect. Unfortunately a couple more edges were found which went to the boundary and GR crossed the finishing line with the loss of 8 wickets. Stand out bowlers were Dom Birkby who took a 5 wicket haul on his return and Jack Hankinson who perhaps bowled too well and remained wicketless.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
350,Prestwood 188-6 BWCC 188-7</p><p>Skipper Kerry left Prestwood on Saturday with a feeling of another job not properly finished.</p><p> Playing the bottom of the league meant that the selction policy had been aimed more towards the youth end of the market rather than the over 50s end. This is fine if you have 11 players on the field but when one of the slightly older members (18) of the side doesn't turn up because he didn't know he'd been picked that makes life a bit harder.Add to that your opening bowler ( Ben Carlin) breaking down in the 3rd over and you definitely have a problem.</p><p> All the bowlers gave their best but it was difficult to get fielders in the right position when you weren't quite sure where the batsmen were going to hit the ball## and that had nothng to do with where it pitched.</p><p> Evan Webster(10-2-30) and new boy AJ Cooper (12-1-40) were the pick of the bowlers. Rob Rose ( 9-1-39) bowled another tidy spell and Michael Senior added some pace to the attack whilst exploring all areas of the pitch.</p><p> Prestwood's opener## Taylor## scored 71 in their 45overs and as he's 62 there's hope for Derek and Nigel yet.</p> Prestwood ended on 188-6.</P><p> With a limited amount of batting it was important tha Ballinger got off to a steady start. Unfortunately Derek Richards decided to see how far away from him the ball needed to be before he could hit straight to point.Jack Bull(13) then joined Will Smith in an enterprising 2nd wicket stand which gave the innings much needed impetous. When he was out out the score was 43 and the Waggoners were up with the run rate.Kerry joined Will Smith at the wicket and with a mixture of luck and skill slowly worked Ballinger into a good position. Will passed 50 for the 2nd match running and had once more shown incredible concentration and much skill##but had he left his skipper with too much to do? 73 off 13 overs was very attainable but how much batting was left? Michael Senior(14) helped add 21 in 5 overs then Bastie Richards and Kerry put on another 39.The pressure was mounting for both sides and with Evan Webster out on 180 in the penultimate over it was all down to the last over</p><p> Kerry on strike and 9 required to win. 1st ball big swipe and a miss## 2nd ball big swipe and a miss## 3rd ball proper shot and a 6.3 required of 3 balls and what does Kerry do off the 4th ball? He takes a single.This left Rob Rose on strike with the instruction to run at all costs## unfortunately he hadn't been told he also had to hit the ball. Run out! AJ in his first innings has to score 2 off the last ball to win the game. Sadly he only managed a single and the scores were tied</p><p> This Prestwood side were a far better team than we had played against before and although we should have won## there was no disgrace in coming away with a winning draw.</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
352,<p> Occupation of joint top-spot in the MBL Premier Division was evidently a step too far for Ballinger's batsmen## and the match at home v Downley saw them tumble back to the real world. Matt Riley won the toss## and decided that our recent performances batting first were good enough for him to repeat the process. Alas## our run-machines Humphreys## McIntyre and Davies all had an off day## and the only bright spots in a rather shabby batting display were Matt himself## who played his way back into form after a very lean spell following his come-back from injury## making an invaluable 67## and a hard-hitting 27 by Tom Graham. We failed to bat out our overs## and the total of 146 was never going to worry Downley## who had 48 overs at their disposal. </p><p> Downley's batsmen showed how quick singles can pressurize a fielding side## and although their prolific openers were dismissed relatively cheaply## there was little joy thereafter for Ballinger's bowlers## not helped by some indifferent fielding. A rapid 3rd wicket partnership of 86 destroyed any hopes we might have entertained## and although two wickets fell late on## Downley sailed to 150-4 in only 29 overs. </p><p> Ballinger were deservedly beaten by far superior opponents## and need to bounce back quickly from this set-back. </p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
353,<p>Hyde Heath 213-9 BWCC 170-9</p><p>Ballinger made the short trip to Hyde Heath in what was billed as the big game of the weekend## never mind the Lions or Wimbledon## Hyde Heath was the place to be.</p><p>The day started well for Ballinger as captain Salisbury won the toss and elected to field. Soon both opening batsmen were back in the pavilion relatively cheaply with both Jack Hankinson and Dom Birkby bowling tightly. However this brought Shrimpton to the crease who mixed attack and defence to good effect and punished anything short or wide. He passed 50 in double quick time and held the Hyde Heath innings together as no other batsmen stayed long enough to form a considerable partnership. New boy Carlton Siddle was the chief destroyer bowled a miserly 11 over spell and taking 3 wickets. In the end Hyde Heath closed on 213-9 off 44 overs. Wickets were shared between Birkby (1)## Hankinson (3)## Siddle (3) and Humphries (2).</p><p>After tea the Ballinger reply got of to a great start with the opening pair of Paul Humphries and Will Smith. Both looked at ease on an increasingly friendly batting track and put on 93 for the first wicket before Paul bowled for 53. Unfortunately no one else could get the big score that was required to win the game and when Will was out for 47 it looked like Ballinger would have to settle for the draw## which they duly did ending on 170-9 from 40 overs. Other notable batting contributions came from Kellock (19) and Siddle (13).</p><p>In the end both teams played but in the end it would seem a draw was the correct result.</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
354,<p> Playing at Holmer Green has never been at the top of Ballinger's wish-list## but for once the pitch behaved itself## which is more than can be said for the opposition's fielders## who seemingly pride themselves on a version of sledging from a few of their senior players## who one might think should know better##that verges on the offensive. That said## Ballingers's batsmen## batting first after losing the toss##spent most of their time ducking and weaving against fast and furious bowling## rather than worrying about the verbals. Openers Riley and Kellock had both departed by the time the score had reached 24 off 10 overs## but then Rollo McIntyre was joined by Ian Davies in an initially nervy but increasingly confident stand of 56 for the 3rd wicket## before Rollo fell for a hard-earned 40. Richard O'Kelly was next in## and helped Ian add 91 for the 4th wicket## before he went for an excellent 34. Ian then upped the tempo and was 83 not out when the 45 overs finished## a match-saving knock one might have hoped## giving us a total of 197-5.</p><p> By the time Holmer Green commenced their innings the clouds were threatening## and light drizzle gradually turned heavier## the ball turned into a bar of soap## and our bowlers found nowhere near as much life in the wicket as had the home bowlers. A further disadvantage was an injury to our steadiest bowler## Andy Thompson## which limited him to a mere 4 overs.Two interruptions saw us return in increasingly unpleasant conditions## but the wickets refused to come## a couple of dropped catches not helping. Holmer Green had reached 172 before their second wicket fell## with both K and B King making 50's## and although two more fell in quick succession thereafter## it was too late## and for the second week running we went down by 6 wickets. </p>,Nigel,2010-02-11

358,<p>BWCC 228-7 Amersham Hill 228-5<p/><p>After last weeks no show from the opposition## Ballinger returned to action against Amersham Hill## albeit in a 40 over contest## on what turned out to be a nice sunny day## in complete contrast to the previous day's rainfall.<p/><p>Surprisingly## the ground had dried out well after the rain and Ballinger won the toss and## as usual## chose to bat first. However## this decision looked questionable as after just 2 overs both openers## Phil Lloyd and Jamie Kellock## had perished for ducks leaving Ballinger 4-2. All was not lost though## as Jamie had immediately worked out that Phil had faced fewer balls## thus avoiding the collection of match fees. Staring down the barrel Ballinger slowly began to rebuild with Paul Humphreys (35) and Jack Maciver pushing the score over 50 with a partnership of 53. Jeremy Hunting (25) and Tom Maw (9) continued the scoring## sharing partnerships of 67 and 37 respectively with Jack. Eventually## he fell for a very well made 79 where he was particularly proficient through the leg side. Late order runs from Graham Salisbury (14)## Nick Tegg (11*) and a blistering 29* from Basty Richards helped Ballinger reach 227-7 from their allotted 40 overs.<p/><p>In reply## Hill got off to what one might call an eventful start. Opening batsmen## Hedley## firstly called for the miniature sightscreens at each end of the ground to be moved a matter of millimetres and then secondly asked that Ballinger's Jimmy Gibbs be removed from the bowling attack for bowling 2 over head height no-balls. (Strictly true## but not really in the 'Spirit of Sunday Cricket'). This was not the end however## as Hedley was on his way back to the pavilion minutes later after being run out## trying to take on the tracer like arm of Jack Maciver. Meanwhile## a couple of balls later a very confident appeal for caught behind was turned down. And that was all in Jimmy Gibb's first couple of overs! At the other end Jack Maciver was operating less eventfully bowling a fast accurate opening spell applying pressure to the Hill batting line up. Soon enough 2 wickets had been taken## which brought Mackenzie and Telford to the crease. Early on it looked like both men would be dismissed relatively cheaply but as they survived a couple of dropped catches confidence grew## as did a partnership. Eventually## Mackenzie went for a 63 when he was caught low down by Maciver. Telford## though## carried on his more agricultural approach and bludgeoned his way past 50 and beyond## smashing many a ball out of the small ground and into the gardens. Unfortunately for him## he fell just 2 runs short of a quick fire century when bowled by Maciver. Collins soon followed for a duck (again bowled by Maciver) and Ballinger sensed the game was starting to swing back towards them. However## Joseph played a controlled innings of 29* to guide Hill home by 4 wickets## finishing on 228-6.<p/>,Nigel,2010-02-11
360,<p> One might have thought that bottom of the league Waddesdon## on winning the toss on a damp looking wicket at Ballinger## would opt to field first. Instead## they batted## and indeed batted very competently in the face of a Ballinger attack that was rather mundane. It was only by dint of two superlative catches## first by skipper Riley## then by Phil Lloyd## that the first two wickets were taken## by which time the score stood at 118 in the 30th over. Sadly## Phil injured his shoulder in the process## and with Nick Adams already having done his back in## we were short of bowling resources. Fortunately## Ian Maciver (4-49) was bowling well## supported by son Jack## and Andy Thompson (2-16)## himself bowling gingerly after last week's injury## and a target of 180'ish looked likely until an entirely unexpected assault by R Ullah## a teenager who looked much younger than his years and made 20 off only 9 balls.</p><p> Ballinger should really not have been troubled in chasing a total of 209 to win. However## Paul Humphreys gifted his wicket wafting at a wide ball. There followed an impressive partnership of 108 between Matt Riley and Rollo McIntyre## and when the latter fell for 68## the score was already 123 in the 29th over## ahead of the game. However## the light was deteriorating steadily## and the troublesome Mr Ullah appeared and proceeded to bowl extremely fast. Rain stopped play after 32 overs with Ballinger on 132## now behind on run-rate. 4 overs were lost## but more importantly so too was our momentum. Wickets fell quickly trying to speed the scoring rate## but with the loss of Riley (59) the task was beyond us## and at 167-8 after 41 overs the rain returned and left us with a very disappointing losing draw. </p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
361,<p> Winning the toss at Widmer End## skipper Riley lost no time in asking the opposition to bat on a damp looking wicket.

Then##hooray## Degelas was bowled by Rollo for 57## following which the remaining batsmen collapsed in spectacular style## with Ian Maciver (6-20) the main destroyer## Rollo bagging 2-16## and the innings was concluded in the 34th over for 106.</p><p> Faced with making 107 in 56 overs## Ballinger then proceeded to make thoroughly hard work of the job.

364,<p> BWCC 222 all out Ibstone 195-9 (all out)</p><p> Matches against Ibstone are liable to be high-scoring affairs - the previous fixture was lost by Ballinger defending in vain a total of 197-6## having been invited to bat first## but it was a close-run thing## with Ibstone wobbling badly towards the end of their chase. This Saturday##things went rather differently.

Thereafter## apart from an attractive cameo 22 from Ian Davies the remaining batsmen all contrived to get themselves out without reaching double figures## whilst Matt held the innings together## being fifth out when the score was 187. Ibstone## fielding only 10 men## held their catches well and fielded impressively## and Ballinger's final total at 45 overs of 222 all out looked vulnerable on a good batting track. </p><p> Ibstone set off after their target as if they had a plane to catch. Despite their losing an early wicket to Nick Adams## the score fairly rattled along## with opener Redrup in magnificent form. Unfortunately for Ibstone their early batsmen were simply too impatient## and courtesy of two fine catches by Charlie Wells## they were soon 60-3## but with only 10 overs gone. Ballinger's under-strength bowling was suffering## with Jack Maciver## unusually## having a bad day even though he bagged a couple of wickets. When the next wicket fell Ibstone had reached 157 in a mere 22 overs## and Ballinger were staring down the barrel. But it was the key man Redrup who perished for a superb 121## clean bowled taking an ill-considered swing at a good delivery from Ian Maciver. That proved the turning point. The Ibstone wobble reappeared## and Paul Humphreys (4-38) and Ian Maciver (1-24) took control## with Nick Adams reappearing to finish with 2-44. </p> <p>Ibstone ended 28 short of their target## and with only 38 overs gone## had they adopted a less cavalier approach## they could surely have made it. A fine win## though## for Ballinger## and one that keeps them hard on the heels of league leaders Knotty Green. </p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
365,BWCC 187-8Aylesbury 189-5 <p> Skipper Kerry new this was going to be a tough one and it would have helped if he could have won the toss</P><p> it would also have helped if he had 11 players. Another avoidable cockup.</P><p> None of the batsmen looked in any trouble but against a tight bowling attack on a very good pitch most got themselves out. Will Smith top scored with 34## Nick Tegg(28) ## Jack Hankinson(29)and Ben Carlin( 21)all added valuable runs but 187 was never going to be enough.</P><p> Jack Hankinson( 3-43) did his best but with the wicket playing well and the Aylesbury batsmen prepared to chance their arm it didn't take long for them to knock off the runs</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
366,BWCC 60- 10 ib 35 oversWaddesden 64-6 in 19 overs<p> If ever a toss decided a match this was it and skipper Kerry wasn't the most popular member of the team when he informed his team mates that they were batting.</P><p> It was dreadful and the home side didn't need the help of some interesting umpiring decisions to make life difficult for the Waggoners. After 16 overs two of the clubs more aggressive batsmen in Peter Petrie and Jeremy Hunting had managed to acquire 27 runs between them. The wicket was drying out and was obviously going to be easier to bat on later but that wasn't any good to us as we all contrived to get out leaving us on only 60.</P><p> This was never likely to be enough and a few lust blows from some of the early Waddesden batsmen made it look even easier but the team stuck at it and and managed to get the home side 6 down again with some help from the umpire. Sadly it was all over in the 19th over and the skipper was to blame!</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
368,Cadmore End 143 -10BWCC 145 - 4 <p> Having seen the whole square under water on Friday skipper Kerry was keen to win the toss and let the visitors have first go on what could only have been described as a slow wicket. When he lost but the oppo still elected to bat first he had to ask if he'd heard correctly</P><p> It was impossible to decide what was going to be a winning score so when the vistors started off at around 3 an over and had posted 50 by the 16th Ballinger weren't sure whether they had control or not. Ben Carlin removed their danger man Dutton and then the first wicket for the 2s for Max Maciver followed by a bizarre run out got Bllinger back in the game. The introduction of Tom McIntyre changed the whole innings. He took 5 - 17 in 5 overs of high quality leg spin. Cadmore were thus bowled out for 143.<p> Cadmore's bowling was some what eratic and the 23 extras helped,Nigel,2010-02-11
369,<p>The Lee 164 AO BWCC 138-7<p/><p>On a day when the construction of the Tower of Pisa began 836 years ago and Edward VII was crowned king of the United Kingdom a mere 107 years ago exactly## Ballinger faced their battle Royale as they played near neighbours## The Lee## for only the third time this weekend (both Saturday teams had done battle the day before). The scene was set and so it started## as The Lee won the toss and chose to bat and bat and bat…<p/><p>After an intense pre-match warm up## which didn't include 5-a-side football## Ballinger took to the field with a good mix of youthful enthusiasm and experience and no little confidence after the heroics of both Saturday sides the day before. Jack Maciver took the new ball and was right on the money straight away as he started off with 2 maidens; meanwhile## at the other end Tom Maw operated equally efficiently and was soon ripping into The Lee's top order with his pace and steepling bounce. Well## not really. However## his sedate medium pace did cause a few problems and was rewarded with the wickets of Phelps and Channer. Jack kept up his tight line## but unfortunately## remained wicketless from his first 5 over spell. His replacement from the 'White Hut' end was Jamie Kellock## who rolled back the years to bowl a miserly 9 over spell which kept the squeeze on The Lee's score. However## enter P Neal## ex-Hertfordshire captain and apparently the star of The Lee's batting line up. He quickly moved onto 28 and looked likely to help The Lee recover from a shaky start. But he had not counted on a perfectly concocted plan by bowler Kellock and captain Salisbury which put paid to that. A perfectly disguised longhop was creamed straight to short midwicket into the grateful hands of Salisbury (he hasn't dropped a catch in 4 years did you know?). 3 wickets down soon became 4 as that man## Kellock## did it again as Jones was bowled by a ball that sent the leg stump cart wheeling into the next county. Once the medium pacers had had enough## mainly due to tiredness## the spin quartet where brought on to try and tidy up The Lee's lower order. However## father and son combination of John and Julian Swain had other ideas and they steadily accumulated runs. Jake 'little man' Cutter bowled better than his figures suggested but it was Ballinger's very own father and son combination that finished off The Lee. Max Maciver broke the Swain's partnership as he had John Swain caught by resident slip fielder Paul Humphreys. Soon enough father## Ian Maciver## rattled through the lower order which included Julian Swain for a patient 36. With no sign of a declaration in sight Ballinger eventually finished off The Lee for 164## at roughly 5.03PM having bowled 48.1 overs precisely.<p/><p>After a well needed tea Ballinger set about trying to chase down 164. Usually this would be a score that the home side would be confident of chasing down but a combination of limited overs to do it in and the fact they were 14-3 in the 9th over put paid to this. Young Henry Quinn bowled very well (1-6 off 5) and the slightly older Neal made runs very hard to come by as Ballinger were trying very hard to emulate the success## or lack of it## of the England cricket team. Even the stinging Yorkshire words of Geoffrey Boycott could be heard as star bowlers## Kellock and Maw## were out in quick succession to balls that Boycott's grandmother could have hit with a stick of Rhubarb. Anyway## never fear## Jack Maciver continued his ridiculously good batting form of late and helped add 76 for the 4th wicket before his Dad Ian fell for 37. While Jack made batting look a breeze## further wickets fell with Max Maciver (11)## Salisbury (0) and Richards (0) leaving Ballinger 114-7. However## the injured warrior Jeremy Hunting hobbled out## with the aide of a runner (after pulling a hamstring when fielding)## to mostly pad## and occasionally bat## Ballinger to a well deserved draw. He ended on 6*## Jack on a chanceless 59* and Ballinger on 138-7.<p/><p>On reflection it was a fair result on another scorching hot day for cricket. The local derby that had been billed by the national papers as 'The Clash of the Titans' had ended in a not so memorable draw## but special mention goes to Jack Maciver who took his tally to 105 undefeated runs for the weekend against The Lee. (That will do his average no harm at all!).<p/>,Nigel,2010-02-11
370,<p>BWCC 159-9 Cublington 120 AO<p/><p>Exactly a year ago Usain Bolt broke the 100m world record in Beijing; exactly a year later he did it again in Berlin to become the undisputed king of the track. 32 years ago## to the day## Elvis Presley died at his home and was crowded the King of rock and roll. Sunday's match against Cublington gave Ballinger the chance to welcome back two of their very own royals: Will Smith - Prince of Ballinger and Dom Birkby - King of the no-ball. Anyway## onto the match. After both Saturday sides won## the pressure was on to make it a perfect 3 and this duly occurred when Ballinger recorded an ultimately comfortable 39 run victory.<p/><p>Winning the toss## Ballinger had no hesitation in batting first on a wicket that looked as green as the outfield but defied its initial inspection to play consistently throughout the match. The little and large combination of Prince Will and Paul Humphreys opened up for Ballinger and initially runs were hard to come by as Cublington's opening bowlers bowled generally a tight line. At 20-0## just as Humphreys was beginning to get into his stride## he was adjudged LBW for 11 after a slow death that Rudi Koertzen would have been proud of. Things did not get much better as 20-1 soon became 32-2 and then 42-3 as the well-oiled Ballinger machine began to splutter along as Jack Maciver (10) and Fally (3) fell quickly. Some partial relief then followed as Jeremy Hunting (6) and Prince Will shared a partnership of 26 but when Jeremy was out at 68-4 Ballinger were staring right down the barrel. Joining Prince Will at the crease was Tom Maw and these two steadily went about trying to re-build the innings. Prince Will was batting very sensibly and showed what could be done with a bit of patience and soon enough brought up a very well deserved 50## though not before he hit his first 6 in senior cricket. Those that have batted with the diminutive right hander will know that his life long ambition is to hit a straight six## unfortunately for him it was not a straight hit but one that went sailing over square leg## but they all count. Whilst Will went past 50## Tom Maw supported him and hit a couple of lusty blows in his patient 24 before they both perished trying to go for one big shot too many. However## 62 were added for the 5th wicket and at 130-5 the platform was set for some late order impetus. Unfortunately## this did not really materialise as only Mr No-Ball himself## Dom Birkby## got into double figures with a very useful 16* allowing Ballinger to declare on 159-9. Credit must go to Cublington who managed to bowl 46 overs in the allotted time.<p/><p>After tea## Cublington seemed confident of chasing down the Ballinger total as the pitch was still in good condition. And at first the Cublington freight train was steaming along as openers P Orchard and Burton rattled along dispatching the bowling all around the ground. Once Orchard was out## (to Birkby for 4)## wickets started to fall at regular intervals as the Cublington freight train started to hit the buffers## though at 72-2 they were still in with more than a chance. However## the decision by stand-in skipper Ian Maciver to bring on Humphreys from the 'football ground' end perhaps changed the course of the match. His 4 over spell claimed the vital wickets of Burton## for a stylish 46## Mitchell and Farr leaving Cublington teetering on the brink at 96-7. At this point the spin twins of Max Maciver and Basty Richards were brought on and both showed considerable control and guile in the face of older opposition## slowing the freight train almost to a stop. Max's first over was tight as ever while Basty's shall now be christened 'Basty's magical over'. With one over to go before drinks Waugh was the batsman and Richards the bowler. This was not a West Indies vs. Australia match of yesteryear and nor was it at the MCG or Antigua## but Basty bamboozled the batsmen showing the sort of form that bagged him thousands of wickets last year. With 2 balls of the over remaining## the batsmen feigned to charge down the wicket## undeterred Basty bowled a ball of good line and length and induced Waugh into another false stroke but this time it was a top edge straight into the reliable hands of Nick Tegg at gully. The double figure crowd were in raptures! And to top things off## the batsman's follow through resulted in the bat crashing into his head - that is why helmets are useful. Meanwhile at the other end Max toiled away with absolutely no luck whatsoever## with the ball missing bat## pad and stumps by centimetres on numerous occasions and he certainly deserved better figures than 1-14 off 8 overs. 23 were added for the 8th wicket as Squires and Barker delayed the inevitable but as soon as Max trapped Barker in front for 19 the game was over as Basty polished off the Cublington lower order## the final wicket being that of P China who tried to smash the ball to China but only ended up offering up a chance for Fally to show us his rather good juggling skills before finally grabbing hold of the ball on about the 12th attempt.<p/><p>Overall another satisfying performance with everybody in the team contributing. Brief mentions go to Rick Brockett who kept tidily and Dom Birkby who bowled well to collect 3 wickets on his brief return to Ballinger before going on holiday and missing more games. I doubt we'll see him again. Lets hope this good run of form continues next week as we visit Little Gaddesdon.<p/>,Nigel,2010-02-11
371,"""<p> Monks Risborough 148 BWCC 87 </p><p> Another toss won by BWCC## on a gloriously warm## sunny afternnon## and skipper Ian Davies asked lowly Monks Risborough to take first knock on a green-looking strip## although he must have feared what their famously aggressive batsmen might do to a bowling line-up missing the Macivers amongst other regulars.But as his batting was equally denuded## it was a risk worth taking. As things turned out## the Ballinger bowlers did a good job in restricting Monks to 148 all out in 42 overs## with Ian Davies## surrendering the gloves to Richard O'Kelly## taking 4-32## and Tom Graham mopping up the tail with 3-27. Ballinger excelled in the field## with some smart catches## notably a blinder by Tom Maw##and a neat stumping by O'Kelly (should have been two## rumour has it !) </p><p> After a lonely tea break (the opposition being absent due to the rigours of their Ramadan fast)## Ballinger's batsmen set about what should have been a very feasible target## with 48 overs in hand. Sadly## Monks' bowlers had other ideas## and were far too penetrative for Ballinger's flimsy efforts. Both our """"bankers"""" ## Paul Humphreys and Ian Davies perished rapidly## and although Richard O'Kelly hung on in for nearly an hour for 8## no-one else looked like getting on top of the bowling until a spirited last wicket stand of 30 between 13 year old debutant Josh Livingstone## who made a very assured 22 not out## and Nick Adams (14). 87 all out in 41 overs was a pretty lamentable effort for runners-up hopefuls versus relegation candidates. But that's cricket. Hopefully the return of some of our absentees will give the side more success in the final league match## against leaders Knotty Green. </p>""",Nigel,2010-02-11
372,Frieth 181-10BWCC 111 -10<p> A beautiful day and it looked like it was going to be hot but skipper Kerry wasn't sure about the pitch so## now he was back into the groove of winnning the toss## asked Frieth to have a bat</P><p> The Tom and Harry show did us proud by only conceding 30 runs between them in their 11 overs with Tom picking up the one wicket. Evan then bowled a tight spell of five overs during which he had to endure the umpire giving wides against him him then explaining what Evan was doing wrong.Tim got in a cheeky 3 overs 1-17 but it was good to see Batsie back to his wicket taking best. 4-55 was a fair reflection but most concerning was the amount of turn he was getting. - They thought they had problems at the Oval.</p><p> Hary Bartlett bowled with a really bad back and only took 2 wickets in his 6 overs but once again the star of the show was 'Full Toss' Rose. His double act with Bastie at short fine leg was too much for the opposition and they subsided to just 181</P><p> Derek and Harry set off in hot pursuit but it soon became apparent that the wicket was going to be too slow to make run scoring easy.Harry's demise with the score on 32 opened the flood gates and only a bit of a flurry from the tail gave any respectability to the score.<p> It appears that a team consisting of 3 adults and 8 boys isn't going to be strong enough to win matches at this level - at the moment. Another year down the line all the boys who have played this year wil have gained enough experience to move the side forward next year.</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
373,The Lee 213-8BWCC 132 -8<p>This was always going to be a difficult one with only three adults in the side and so it proved.</p><p> The Lee batted first and were soon rattling along at nearly 6 an over. The introduction of Rob Rose( 1-32)brought som sense to the carnage but it wasn't until Tom McIntyre got into the action did Ballinger get any control over things.

Unfortunately by this time The Lee were on their way to a decent score finishing on 213 in their 45 overs.</p><p> In reply The Waggoners were laways going to be up against it wit only 3 adults in the side. Derek Richards(31) and Paul Rose ( 49) did their best but both were out to the wiles of Guy Morgan.</p><p> By the 31st over Ballinger were 8 down and looking down the barrel but Evan and Rob Rose managed to frustrate the visitors by batting for the last 9 overs and thus earning a draw.</p>A miss match in terms of the score but all the boys did well again</P>,Nigel,2010-02-11
374,<p>BWCC 194-8 Little Gaddesdon 156AO</p><p>With considerable pressure to produce a literary masterpiece## the writer has found it a little difficult to write anything of substance this week## but here goes...</p><p>With the Battle of Stalingrad (1942) and the liberation of Kharkov (1943) and Marseille (1944) occurring on this day in history## Ballinger had their own chance to write themselves into the history book as the well-oiled Ballinger machine commenced battle against the 'Gaddenaut'. This was the definition of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object## and as Murray Walker once said “you could cut the tension with a cricket stump”.</p><p>The scene was set: pitch marked out## boundary freshly painted and the opposition warming up (surely not)## but the only problem was that Ballinger had 8 players at 1.50. Finally## with a minute before the scheduled start## Ballinger had 10 players. So now for the 11th… a quick glance at the team sheet led captain Salisbury to realise he would be a man short as an administrative error back at the Ballinger Common stadium had cruelly robbed us of our extra man. Never mind## the game got under way in glorious conditions on what was a perfect day for cricket as the sun was out in a cloudless sky and the pleasant surroundings of the Chilterns provided the back drop. In between the merciless slaying of the Aussies by the English on good old TMS and the occasional complaints from Will Smith at having to bat at No. 3 rather than opening## their was actually a game of cricket going on (who would have thought it?). In form Paul Humphreys and the less in form Jamie Kellock opened up for Ballinger and found the pitch very much to their liking## a batsmen's paradise some might say. Paul was quickly into his stride and looked comfortable while Jamie was less so## although his first scoring shot was a 6. With early nerves dispersed both Paul and Jamie used the massive outfield to full extent and you could have been forgiven for thinking there were two cheetahs running between the wickets as they dispelled any myths about not running 3s## as they did so on 3 separate occasions. This deserves to be repeated for emphasis## PAUL AND JAMIE RAN THREE 3S! They pushed the score onto 116-0## until Jamie (43) holed out to part time wicket keeper/off spinner Odera and soon after Paul followed in similar fashion for 67## being caught at mid on. Will Smith was then the mainstay of the innings with a pugnacious 36## which included loitering outside his crease and tempting the Little Gaddesdon fielders to try and run him out## whilst collecting overthrows when the throws missed! Tom Maw was the next highest with a superb 8* which included a run 4. After 44 overs Ballinger closed on 194-8 and looked forward to what Gaddesdon call 'The Best Teas in The LeagueTM'. They did not disappoint and Ballinger took to the field a little fuller than one would expect of a professional and elite unit such as Ballinger.</p><p>With a decent total to defend and a large outfield## Ballinger's youthful side looked to finish the game before bedtime## and they had a dream start. Jack Hankinson bowled Lupton second ball and then proceeded to terrify one batsman so much that in an attempt to get off strike he ran out his partner. At this stage the rose garden looked… well## rosy but soon enough Marriot and Hodge began to rebuild. As Marriot began to cut loose## Tom Maw smashed his leg stump bail into oblivion and he was on his was for a quick fire 25. This brought Odera to the crease and he made his intentions clear straight away## smashing Rob Rose and Josh Livingstone for some streaky boundaries. The runs kept coming as the ball narrowly avoided any fielder on an increasingly annoying number of occasions. With both batsmen surviving close LBW shouts and the score rattling along## their was only one man to turn to## the old pro Paul Humphreys. Like last week## he turned the game in his 6 over spell as 2 key wickets were taken## including that of the increasingly confident Odera who made a very useful 33. Six wickets down## Little Gaddesdon were by no means out of the game but the combination of Ballinger fielding like Hyenas looking for a kill and Paul Humphreys leaping like a salmon to catch Hodge for 59## the game began to look like a formality. It was duly finished off by Jack Hankinson in the most spectacular way by taking a hat trick (to end with a 5-fer)## although you wouldn't have known it by the muted celebration! So there we have it## the Ballinger machine rolls on with another win and hopefully this will continue next Sunday away at Wendover.</p><p>With everyone retiring to the bar## all that is left to be said is that the game was an enjoyable one## played in the right spirit against very amicable opposition. So therefore## it is very apt to finish this report by quoting English poet Edmund Blunden who once said## “cricket to us was more than play## it was worship in the summer sun.”</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
375,Haddenham 161-10Ballinger 165 -4<p>Ballinger 2s had a comfortable win over lowly Haddenham on Saturday. Skipper Kerry finally managed to win the toss and sent Haddenham into bat. A strong wind made life difficult for opening bowlers Tom Sperring and Josh Livingstone and Haddenham got off to a good start. The introduction of Peter Petrie and then Josh changing ends reduced the run rate and Josh finally sent back Haddenham opener Pawsley. </p><p>Max Maciver ( 4-36) was then brought into action and immediately changed the course of the game. Using the wind cleverly he soon had the home team batsmen in a spin and with Bastie Richards bowling well at the other and Ballinger took control of the game. The introduction of Rob Rose(3-29) also brought success## including the stumping by Will Smith of their skipper McArren who had scored and interesting 57## and with new boy Bartlett cleaning up the tail Haddenham were bowled out for 161.</p><p>Ballinger openers Derek Richards and Will Smith(25) set off at a good pace putting on 60 for the 1st wicket. Max Maciver went cheaply(15) but Harry Bartlett(38) and Derek soon settled the game with a 79 run partnership in just 16 overs. Harry was out to an incredible catch and Tim Rix had to collect the money following his 3rd ball duck.

376,<p>BWCC 235-9 Knotty Green 136 AO</p><p>127 years ago the defeat of England by Australia at The Oval led to the formation of the Ashes cricket series which is recognised by some## but not all## as the battle for the No.1 test side in the world. 127 years on from that day Ballinger hosted Knotty Green as the top 2 sides in the league met in the last league match of the season to battle it out for bragging rights## but not much more## as league positions had already been decided with Knotty Green being declared champions last weekend. With second place secure## Ballinger looked to finish a good season on a high and this duly occurred with a comprehensive 99 run victory over a Knotty Green side that weren't taking the game quite so seriously.</p><p>Winning the toss## captain Ian Davies opted to bat first and opened up with Paul Humphreys and Richard O'Kelly. They were soon into their stride as Paul especially ripped into the bowling## cutting majestically and driving with aplomb. At the other end Richard seemed happy to play the supporting role but both kept the scoreboard ticking over. The 100 partnership was brought up in the 19th over## but only one over later the first wicket fell as Richard was caught for a tenacious 38. 31 runs later Paul was on his way back to the pavilion after counting his way to 85 and in the process achieved 1000 runs for the season. Rollo then followed for 11 after Irvine nonchalantly caught him one handed and it looked like Ballinger's blistering start may be wasted; however## enter Ian Davies and Andy Thompson## these two added 42 in decent time establishing Ballinger's early dominance. When Ian (26) and Andy (9) departed## Jamie Kellock and Tom Maw helped keep the score moving but it was the late innings impetus from Ian Maciver and Phil Lloyd that really pushed Ballinger to a very competitive score## the last 4 overs yielding a massive 52 runs! Ian finished on 24* off 7 balls## including a 6 that ricocheted off a nice shiny BMW leaving a dent for the returning wedding-goers## and Phil who was bowled for 12 having smeared the league's leading wicket taker## Widdowson## for 2 mammoth sixes back over the bowler's head. Never has such fury been unleashed on a cricket ball in the history of the game. Irvine's bowling was particularly savaged as his 2 overs went for 34 runs## although he did pick up the prized wicket of Kellock.</p><p>A typically good Ballinger tea followed## which this week was provided by Rollo who took the meaning of 'freshly prepared' to the next level by making the sandwiches just before play started. After tea## Ballinger took to the field hoping to replicate the bowling performance of last year's home match against Knotty Green (which incidentally was the last match of the season) where the opposition were bowled out for 139. However## it soon became apparent that they would be helped in this task as Knotty had reversed their batting order. As a result## wickets fell at regular intervals as the lower order batsmen could not handle the fearsome Ballinger attack## with Jack Maciver picking up 3 wickets in his first spell and the irrepressible Phil Lloyd getting 2## one of which## a catch by Jack Maciver which looked about 10 times harder than it should have been## although it would have looked good had the Sky cameras been there. With Jack having bowled his ECB allocation of 5 overs## this brought Andy 'Thommo' Thompson on from the 'football pitch' end and he proceeded to bowl with pace and verve that would have put his namesake Jeff to shame. After three overs he had 3 wickets for no runs and although he did eventually concede some runs## this spell turned the match firmly into Ballinger's grasp## with top order batsmen Widdowson and Mahmood## No.8 and 10 respectively## being two of Thommo's victims. At this stage 9 wickets had fallen with 79 on the board## and Ballinger were as hungry as piranhas in a meat shop to wrap up the win. However## usual opener Hill and Bartlett had other ideas and showed some late resistance that was lacking earlier on as many a batsman got out trying to score off every ball. Patience was the name of the game and with 57 added for the 10th wicket Ballinger superstar Jack Maciver finally bowled Bartlett via an inside edge for 42 to finish things off## with Knotty Green bowled out for 136 in a match that virtually mirrored last year's clash.</p><p>Overall## Ballinger produced a thoroughly professional performance with plenty of energy that befitted the day when Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction 178 years previous. Although Ballinger won the match very little changed in terms of standings as Knotty Green became champions of the Kookaburra Mid Bucks Premier League for the first time and Ballinger secured second place for only the second time. Throughout the season Knotty Green have undoubtedly been the most consistent (and friendliest) side and deserve to have won the league## and although we may look at missed opportunities second place must not be scoffed at. Plus we (may) get a medal to boot. Happy days!</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
377,<p>BWCC 200-8 Wendover 201-3</p><p>In recent times## matches against Wendover have usually been close affairs## but ones in which that Ballinger have eventually come out on top## but Sunday was a different story as they crashed and burned to a 7 wicket defeat.</p><p>After many years of playing Wendover at home due to problems with their Ellesborough ground and its proximity to both the Aylesbury bypass and train line## it was a bit of a novelty to play away## and like the space shuttle Discovery taking off on its maiden voyage on this day in 1984## for many of the Ballinger team it was the first time they had played at the ground. Upon arrival## the distinctive hum of the power lines could be heard and this was supplemented by the occasional passing of a car or indeed a train. Furthermore## for the second week running an administrative error back at the Ballinger Common Stadium had left us with 12 players although this was settled quickly enough.</p><p>With 11 players the cricket could begin as we grudgingly decided to play a 40 over shoot out. Stand-in skipper Jeremy Hunting## on his comeback from injury## won the toss and chose to bat first on a decidedly dodgy looking wicket with the sunny delights of Saturday long gone as the sun and blue sky was replaced by a blanket of watery-grey cloud. Whether or not this affected the Ballinger batsmen## who knows## but they did not get off to the greatest of starts. 1000 run man## Paul Humphreys## perished in the second over and 500 run boy Will Smith didn't fair much better## being trapped in front for 7. Jack Maciver showed what some application could do for a well made 20## but when he was caught and then Jeremy was bowled in quick succession## Ballinger were once again staring down the barrel (it seems this phrase is used nearly every week) at 35-4## and things could have been much worse as Ian Maciver clipped a ball straight to midwicket## when he hadn't scored## but thankfully the chance was put down. So with 4 wickets down for 35 runs in the 15th over a period of rebuilding was necessary. Ian Maciver continued his form with the bat## mixing defence with attack while Tom Maw displayed considerable patience to play the supporting role. Slowly## but surely these two began to pull Ballinger out of the mire with the 50 coming up in the 18th over. As the partnership grew the run rate increased with Ian particularly brutal off the back foot and using the large outfield to good effect to bring up his 50. Eventually## when he was on 62 and the score on 128## the partnership of 93 was broken as Ian was bowled by Seabrook after attempting to hit another boundary. A key feature of the partnership was the running between the wickets with the pair running seven 3s and one 4! Joining Tom then was Rob McIntyre and again a very useful partnership of 59 was added with both players taking a liking for the leg side displaying some shots that wouldn't have looked out of place on a hockey pitch. When Rob departed for a hard hitting 26## a score of 200 was on the cards and this is what Ballinger finished on exactly## an excellent effort considering the predicament earlier in the innings with Tom (54*) scoring his maiden Ballinger 50 - a performance most definitely put down to getting in at 1am after the curry the night before. For Wendover## Burns was the standout bowler with 8 overs for 19 picking up 4 wickets.</p><p>Following another excellent tea## Wendover seemed confident in chasing down the total on what they thought was a batting track. The fearsome Ballinger opening bowlers## Jack Maciver and Jack Hankinson## found the going tough early on as the Wendover batsmen started off in what can only be called cavalier fashion## although Hankinson took the first wicket of Hazelbrook for a rapid 22. With the run rate well above the required rate## the old pro Paul Humphrey was once again called upon to make the difference. Unfortunately## his bowling was treated equally disdainfully and the ball was disappearing to the boundary too often for Ballinger's liking## although their was many a time when the ball would land in front## behind or to the side of a fielder but never actually go to them. Very frustrating. Anyway## Green and Heffard continued their carefree batting## swiping the ball on numerous occasions to and over the boundary and although Max Maciver and Tom McIntyre bowled well neither could get that important breakthrough. So with the smell of victory in the air## Wendover captain## Green## was told he was only 4 runs away from his century and so refused a single off the returning Hankinson so he could hit the winning boundary and wrap up a century. However next ball his leg stump was ripped out and it turned out his teammates were having a bit of fun and Green departed for 75! 2 wickets down became 3 down next ball## as middle stump was ripped out this time and Ballinger thought they were back in with a chance. Crowding the bat to prevent those precious last few runs Heffard smeared one over point to wrap up the win and finish on 82*.</p><p>Overall## it was a disappointing result but## as usual## it was a game played in very good spirit against decent opposition. Maybe we should have looked at the weather before the match as it seemed to be a metaphor for our performance## gloomy for the most part with a couple of bright spots. Anyway## onto next week## away at Chesham Bois## and hopefully a return to winning ways for the Ballinger machine. Anyone fancy a curry Saturday night?!</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
378,<p>BWCC 253-5 Chesham Bois 157-7</p><p>Rollo's grand day out</p><p>The onset of September usually signals the beginning of the end of the cricket season for Ballinger and with only 3 matches left after this one the cut-throat world of selection reared its ugly head as plenty of money changed hands during the week as adults and children alike vied for that all important spot among the elite of Ballinger's Sunday side. As it was## a strong Ballinger side made the short journey to Chesham Bois to attempt to continue their imperious form that has seen the likes of Bledlow and Cublington been savaged by the Ballinger machine.</p><p>With the tree-lined surroundings providing the back drop and the sun occasionally squeezing through the branches to scatter some sort of sunlight on the outfield## el capitano Tom Maw## won the toss and decided to have a bat on what looked to be a decent batting track. Opening the batting for Ballinger was Matt Riley and club pro Paul Humphreys. After a rather circumspect start with Matt playing out a maiden## the second over brought drama. O'Brian's 4th ball swung down the leg side with Humphreys attempting to play the ball down to fine leg for it only to end up in the wicket keepers gloves. A muted appeal then followed as did the dreaded finger of doom## consigning Paul to another week before another attempt to break the record for runs scored in a season. It is not for me to say whether it was out or not## but let's just say Paul was not too happy. Furthermore## there have been reports that current record holder## Danny Draper## was seen to be hiding in the trees surrounding the ground at the time of the dismissal prompting suspicions of serious foul play. An internal investigation has been launched. Anyway## back to cricketing matters## joining Matt at the crease was Rollo McIntyre-Hunting and both soon got into their stride with Rollo especially playing with considerable authority. With each bad ball being ruthlessly dispatched to or over the boundary Ballinger rattled along at a good rate as the 100 partnership was brought up in the 19th over. The mix of Rollo's flamboyance and Matt's obduracy proved to be a perfect partnership## but unfortunately## all good things must come to an end## as the partnership of 115 was broken when Matt was caught for a well made 54. This brought Ian Maciver to the crease and he helped Rollo add 37 for the third wicket in double quick time until he took one swipe too many at Holloway's bowling and was bowled for 8. Will Smith then kept Rollo company for a while until he was caught. Tom Maw then swiftly followed as seeing Paul's anguish at getting out## played a captain's innings to relieve him of collecting duties by getting out to the worst shot in cricketing history as a full toss## which Geoffrey Boycott's grandmother could have hit for six with a stick of rhubarb no less## was tamely hit back to the bowler for a caught and bowled. This dismissal paved the way for Max Maciver to support Rollo McIntyre-Hunting to blast the Chesham Bois bowlers around the park and occasionally into orbit. Soon enough Rollo passed 100 for the second time this season and really began to cut loose with the ball often looking like a dot on the horizon as it disappeared out of the ground. This was not the end## though## as the last couple of overs received particularly brutal treatment. 40 runs were plundered off the last 2 overs as such savagery has not been seen since the publication of William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies'. Eventually Ballinger finished on 253-5 off 37 overs with Rollo McIntyre-Hunting finishing on 148*## a new club record## (of which 130 came in boundaries: 22 fours 7 sixes)## and Max Maciver on a very good supporting 23*. For Chesham Bois## Holloway was the stand out bowler with 4 wickets and Hinks bowled economically as ever.</p><p>After tea the Chesham Bois response began at a rapid rate with 25 coming off the first 2 overs## but as the Ballinger opening bowlers## Nick Adams and Tom Graham## began to find their rhythm the run rate was strangled considerably although no breakthrough came until the score had reached 66. Change bowlers Ian and Max Maciver both bowled very tidily and slowly but surely started to chip away at the Chesham Bois batting order. Clark was trapped in front for a breezy 35 and when Ian picked up his second wicket## that of J O'Brian for 4## Ballinger were back in the hunt. Max soon followed his father's footsteps as he too got in on the act by picking up 2 wickets## the opener Withams for a patient 27 and Kitching for no score## both caught by the strategically placed Nick Adams and Ian Maciver respectively. With Ballinger bowling and fielding well## none more so than Paul Humphreys who prowled the cover boundary with particular enthusiasm and vigour## a positive result looked on the cards. However## they did not bank on stonewall Holloway leading his side to a draw. Although Max continued to toil away with little luck## Alex Howe bowling an excellent ECB restricted 4 over spell where he picked up 2 wickets and the old pro remaining wicketless## Ballinger could not press home their advantage fully (even with 10 players around the bat) and although Nick Adams took another wicket to set up a potentially close finish Chesham Bois saw off the remaining overs with little fuss and therefore## finishing the match on 157-7 off 42 overs with Holloway making 45*.</p><p>So as another match passes and the end of season draws even closer## Ballinger can probably reflect on this match as a missed opportunity but it was a decent game with the major highlight being Rollo McIntyre's majestic and magical 148 not out. Chesham Bois proved to amicable hosts and although the result was not perfect it was good to bounce back after last week's loss. Next week Ballinger visit pastures new as they travel to Jordan Taverners and rumour has it they provide food after the match. I'm looking forward to it already!</P><p>Disclaimer: The views expressed in this report are that of the author and not of the club.

379,<p>BWCC 207-9 Jordans Taverners 171-9</p><p>In 1922 the Great Fire of Smyrna marked the beginning of the end of the Greco-Turkish War. In 2009 Ballinger's match away at Jordans Taverners marked the beginning of the end of the 2009 season as for the first time the start was brought forward by an hour to 1 o'clock. With Ballinger putting out one of the strongest Sunday sides## possibly in world cricket## Jordans Taverners eventually succumbed to a 37 run defeat that perhaps was much closer than it should have been.</p><p>On a rather overcast Sunday afternoon visited Seer Green for the first time to play Jordans Taverners and having lost the toss Ballinger were put in on a pitch that looked like it would deteriorate as the game went on. With the Ballinger line up providing a plethora of riches## the capacity crowd were expecting something special in this 40 over shoot out especially after last weeks fun and fireworks at Chesham bois. Opening up for Ballinger were Matt Riley and Paul Humphreys and the Ballinger innings really set off at break neck speed. 0-0 after 2 overs: tremendous stuff. However runs were gradually accumulated on a tricky pitch and the 50 partnership came up in the 14th over as the run rate began to crawl above 3 an over. Unfortunately record hunter Paul Humphreys was first to go for 31## bowled by Paine## most certainly put off by Danny Draper's appearance behind the bowlers arm. This paved the way for the newly crowned King Rollo and scorer of thousands of runs last weekend to enter the fray much to the joy of the crowd who anticipated another innings of flamboyance and ferocity. It all looked well as his first scoring shot was a 6 but then the unthinkable happened with Rollo bowling bowled for 6and the score on 73. Richard O'Kelly then helped Matt consolidate and slowly but surely the run rate was dragged up with the 3rd wicket partnership reaching 62 until Matt went for a patient 55## an innings that suited the perilous situation that faced Ballinger and which provided a foil for Richard to play his shots. Eventually he then went for a stylish 46 and at 154-4 the platform was set for Ballinger to reach 200. This was indeed exceeded as Jamie Kellock (19) and Nick Adams (16*)## along with extras and dropped catches (which were cruelly laughed at by Mr. Chairman)## helped accelerate the scoring rate with Ballinger eventually finishing on a rather good total of 207-9## a much higher score than initial estimates had forecasted.</p><p>There is one glaring omission from the Ballinger first innings that I have not included though as it deserves its own paragraph. For many years coaches have gone on about how aggressive running between the wickets puts pressure on the fielding side## well there was no better example when openers Paul Humphreys and Matt Riley completed an all run 4## the crowd could not believe it and to top it off there was no dive sight!</p><p>After tea Jordans had the unenviable task of chasing down the target of 207 on an increasingly bowler friendly pitch. Ballinger opening bowlers Jack Maciver and Andy Thompson kept it tight early on and Andy was soon rewarded with the wicket of Leybourne. However it was only after the introduction of Nick Adams and Ian Maciver that the reigns really began to be pulled in and Jordans reply started to hit the buffers. A miserly 8 over spell from Nick ripped the heart out of the Jordans middle order## yielded only 15 runs and 3 wickets while Ian unluckily remained wicketless conceding only 17 runs. At this point victory was virtually assured with 3 further wickets from King Rollo and 1 from club pro and bat supplier Paul Humphreys even despite some absolutely abysmal attempts at catching the small red ball particularly by the captain (yes it was 3 drops). Eventually## Ballinger's victory was wrapped up pretty uneventfully with Andy Thompson finishing with very economical figures and was unlucky to pick up only 1 wicket## while Jeremy Hunting showed plenty of flight and guile in an economical 2 over spell which yielded 40 runs.</p><p>In summary another good win in which Paul was unlucky not to break the coveted runs scored in a season record## never mind there's always next week. Anyway a match against new opposition turned out to be very fruitful with good opposition## good tea and good post match nourishment. Lets hope for another away match next season!</p>,Nigel,2010-02-11
381,On a glorious September day Ballinger entertained Sarratt for the first time in many years. Once all the pleasantries had been exchanged to the ex Ballinger players and opening bowlers from other local clubs (Ley Hill) ## and someone had finally arrived with a key to the pavilion## skipper Salisbury won the toss and elected to bat.</p><p>Openers Humphreys and Riley began the innings in circumspect fashion due to some excellent opening spells from Helm and Lumley. Once they had settled in to the pace of the pitch## which had to be flooded 48 hrs before by the grounds men due to the unseasonal heat wave over Ballinger over the past month (good decision Ian!!) the scoring rate picked up. Humphreys counted himself to 48 which took him past the club record for the most runs in the season## and then decided to ruin the figures of Sarrats top wicket taker this year by taking 23 one over.</p> Paul eventually departed for 73 caught on the 3rd attempt## but this only brought in Rollo## who signalled his intentions by hitting his second ball for 4 and his fifth for 6.Whilst all this was going on Matt was quietly going about his work and reached his hundred with an enormous single## and once the over was finished skipper Salisbury declared with BWCC on 233-1. Matt scored an excellent 101no and Rollo 32no.</p>After the usual Ballinger gastronomic feast Sarratt began their reply but were soon in trouble as Tom Graham 3-30## and Nick Adams 1-23 reduced Sarratt to 46-4.Ballinger's change bowlers kept the wickets falling at regular intervals with Lloyd (2-21) and Max MacIver (4-29) bowling Sarratt out for 125.Top scorer for Sarratt was Randell with 35.</p>An excellent game played in the right spirit## and plenty of jugs down the Swan to finish with.,Nigel,2010-02-11
382,Ballinger had a gentle opener to the season against Chorley Wood on Sunday. Ballinger fielded first and an excellent opening spell by Humphreys and Adams kept Chorley Wood in check reducing them to ? for 3 after ? overs. <br> The introduction of Ollie Richards was interesting with 18 coming off his first over then a double wicket maiden in his second. With Ian Davies bowling well at the other end Chorleywood were reduced to 70 -7. An excellent innings by ? helped Chorleywood reach 171. <br><br>Matt Riley started his season with a well paced innings of 71. Some excellent running between the wickets with Graham Salisbury kept Ballinger in with a shout until the last 2 overs. BWCC eventually finishing on 141- 7 with a very alert Kerry keeping out the last few balls. <br> A difference of 6 overs in Chorleywood's favour probably made the difference but it was very pleasant match played in an excellent spirit. Shame we have to start the league season.,,2010-02-11
383,<p>An almost full strength Ballinger side went to the Nags head ground on Sunday and## in the end## enjoyed a comfortable victory.</p> <p>Batting first Riley & Salisbury got Ballinger off to a slow but steady start but the side slipped to 56 -6 before Lloyd## Fallowfield-Smith & extras brought Ballinger up to 130.</p> Adams & Lloyd then made short work of the Pelicans batting taking 2&3 wickets respectively for a total of 13 runs. Lawson's spin removed another 3 but the prized wicket was taken by pace man Tom Graham when he removed the Pelicans top scorer M.Hull.</P><p>An excellent evening was enjoyed in the Nags Head afterwards.</p>,,2010-02-11
384,The first league game and the question is are we ready? Skipper Matt Riley had a good start to the tossing season when the opposition made the wrong call. Asking Monks to bat first looked like a good choice when## after 20 overs## they had only score 72. Phil Lloyd led the way with 0-14 in his first 6 overs. He was ably supported by Tom Graham with 0-20 in his 6 overs. The introduction of spin increased the wicket taking but## unfortunately## also the run rate. Ian Davies ended with a creditable 3-52 off his 12 overs but Monks Risborough finished on 215-10## which included 37 extras. BWCC set off at an incredible pace scoring 28 off just 16 overs. A 50 partnership between Davies & Hunting gave Ballinger a chance but time (overs) weren't on their side and although Davies reached 85* he was unable to get Ballinger close enough to force the win. Reaching 180-6 meant a loosing draw but by bowling the opposition out## plus batting points## gave Ballinger a reasonable start to their campaign. <i>BWCC 10pts Monks Risborough 15pts.</i>,,2010-02-11
386,BWCC Under 11b's lost a close fought 1st round Cup match against Wendover last Sunday. Batting first Wendover scored slowly but steadily against some tight bowling by BWCC. Wickets then fell at regular intervals with Dan Stockdale picking up 3 catches behind the stumps including one great one-handed effort. Wendover increased their run rate over the last 6 overs of their inning by running & calling well. Harriet Stone slowed the run flow with a great spell including a wicket## but Wendover's best batter took his toll on a sloppy last few overs from Ballinger. Wendover ended on 255 with BWCC having taken 7 wickets. BWCC also off to a slow start in their inning but crucially no wickets were lost. Although behind the run rate BWCC were always in with a chance## unfortunately then two quick wickets did fall which undid all the early good work and with 58 needed off the last 9 overs all seemed lost. However some solid and safe shot making## plus a few extras helped the Ballinger cause and the run rate was kept to 5 or 6 an over. The good news was that all of the batters were contributing to the effort## particularly James and Matthew Rose## Dan Stockdale and Harry Rix. Our last pair## Harriet Stone and Will Clarke needed 21 off the last four overs - a hard ask when Wendover's County player swapped his gloves for the ball but some good calling## quick singles and a few extras kept BWCC in the chase leaving us just 9 to win with 8 balls to go. As often happens when the pressure is on for runs## a desperate attempt at a single resulted in a run out## even then Harriet and Will stuck to their task and took 8 off the last over to cut the final margin between the teams to just 7 runs. The lessons learnt? Practice that ground fielding## think about fielding positions for each batsman and when batting get that calling LOUD and FAST! Well played everyone!,,2010-02-11
387,On a very windy first day of the season Cublington won the toss and decided to bat first. They had a very lucky first over that went for 15 runs. Beginning of the season rustiness by Ballinger bowlers and fielders. Ballinger fought back with some very tight bowling by Harry Wells## Evan Webster and Robert Rose pegging the batsmen back and taking some well deserved wickets. The bowling continued to be tight backed up by some very athletic fielding## the star fielder being Andrew Rishton in the covers. With the last Cublington pair coming to the wickets they were on 225. These batsmen hit the ball hard and scored quick runs. This did not faze Harry Wells who continued with his line and length taking a brilliant bowled middle stump in the last over. Ballinger started their fight back with some patient batting with the first pair of Andrew Rishton and Tom McIntyre. There was some classic strokes in their stand of 15 not out. Harry Wells and Robert Rose continued in the same vein but were really unlucky to be out on their last ball to the catch of the season. Tom Butterworth and Toby King put up some stout opposition but unfortunately lost a few wickets. Rory Seekins and Guyan Ratnavel ran really well between the wickets and gave some lusty blows to take the score to 225. The last pair of Evan Webster and Tom Edmonds came to wicket and with 2 glorious 4's of the first 2 balls by Tom the 245 seemed in sight. A wicket and some tight bowling took the score out of sight. With 15 runs scored off the last over this brought Ballinger's score to 235 and made everyone realise that the catch off the no ball## the LBW not given or the spilt chance was the difference between the teams. The U11C's were gracious in defeat congratulating Cublington and look forward to concentrating on the league.,,2010-02-11
388,Danny Draper made his first appearance of the season for Ballinger today and it looked as though he had put the miseries of last season behind him. Opening with Rick Brockett he scored an excellent 46 but was by no means the leader in an opening partnership of 47. Brockett scored a brisk 23 unfurling a whole range of shots previously unseen by his team mates. 21 from Andy Branigan helped BWCC to reach 174-8 declared. Excellent opening spells of 3-42 by Peter Rushforth & 2-11 by Ian Davies reduced Taplow to 44-5 but BWCC were unable to press home their advantage and Taplow ended on 103-8,,2010-02-11
390,We were unfortunately knocked out of the first round of the cup despite a good first effort from the boys. Top batsmen: Luke Martin 31 (retired not out); and Stefan Otto 15. Top Bowlers: Alex Morgan (2 wickets)## and one wicket each from Privett## Martin & Hutson.,,2010-02-11
392,The game was played at Aston Clinton on Friday 13th May (not a good omen) in bright sunshine. Sadly BWCC had only 9 players and lost the toss. BWCC were asked to bat and their opening bowler quickly disposed of our top 3 batsmen. A couple of badly judged runs which led to run-outs did not help the team. BWCC were all out for 48 with only 14 runs coming off the bat. BWCC bowlers did not have much of a total to defend and Aston Clinton reached their target in 11 overs. Brough and James Stoddart both bowled well and took a wicket each.,,2010-02-11
393,Ballinger enjoyed the short trip to The Lee on Saturday when they gained a comfortable victory over their very local rivals. Asked to bat first Ballinger reached 187- 8 thanks mainly to a far from chanceless 109 by Rollo McIntrye. He was well supported by Matt Riley who scored a dogged 44. They put on 129 for the 2nd wicket which was just as well as no other Ballinger batsman got into double figures. The Lee got off to a flying start but eventually accurate bowling by Humphreys and Adams## who took 3 wickets each## gave Ballinger control and only an excellent innings of 60 from Warren Davies kept The Lee in the game. Spin duo Davies & Maciver with 2 wickets each finished off The Lee innings. BWCC 25pts The Lee 6pts.,,2010-02-11
395,Batting and Bowling orders sorted this time! Some good captaining from Dominic Hutson## particularly with the team one man short on the day - some excellent all-round fielding. An impressive game## and a good start to the season of league games. Aston Clinton 93 all out (.... the last ball being Jack Hankinson's stunning one-ball over in the 15th to knock the opposition out !!!!!!!!) Ballinger 140 runs for 3. Best Batsmen: Luke Martin 32 retired not out; Sam Privett 29 not out## Chris Keen 26 (who decided that wearing boxer shorts with a box meant he'd have to hit 4's rather than run anything !!!!!!!!!!!!!) Best Bowlers: James Stoddart (2 wickets including a stunning caught & bowled .... and he nearly got a 3rd !!!); Dominic Hutson (3 wickets); Sam Privett 1 wicket and Jack Hankinsons (1 wicket off his one & only ball),,2010-02-11
396,The game was played on Tuesday 17th May on a bright sunny evening at Ballinger CG. As some Chalfont players were delayed in arriving## with each captains agreement## Chalfont batted first. Chalfont fielded some good batsmen and they reached 154-2 off 20 overs with Jeff Moxom capturing the 2 wickets. There were good bowling performances from Brough Downey## James Miller and Will Cousins. Sadly many runs were given away with wides## byes and backing up. In reply## BWCC start badly with James Miller being run-out through lack of clear calling between the 2 batsman. Brough Downey batted very well for his 30 runs and held the innings together as wickets fell regularly through the innings. At the end of the innings Lewis Ostacchini batted well for his 13n.o. The low sun in the sky did not help some of the BWCC batsmen - they will have to learn to cope with this.,,2010-02-11
397,Chenies won the toss and put Ballinger into bat. Ballinger did not build on there good batting of last week and managed to lose ten wickets in their 20 overs. This was due to poor shot selection## bad luck and tight bowling. Tom Edmunds and Evan Webster were the only pair to bat through their four overs without losing any wickets. Chenies opened there batting confidently and scored 237 for 4 in their 20 overs## winning comfortably. Congratulations to Chenies and to Xavier Owen making his Ballinger debut. He shows as a 7year old he has quite a future in cricket.,,2010-02-11
398,On a cold## windy night at Shardoloes cricket ground Ballinger under 11A's played their second game of the season. Amersham won the toss and chose to bat. Our opening bowlers Alex Morgan and Adam Robinson put their first pair under a huge amount of pressure and managed to take 6 wickets in the first four overs it has to be said that Amersham were trying to run everything and this proved costly for them! Clever fielding and good positional tactics from George Bartlett the captain kept runs to the minimum with Sam King and Sebastian Richards proving their worth in the field. Wickets continued to fall with George Bartlett## Jeremy Steel## George Bailey and Oliver Lloyd all causing chaos with their accurate bowling. Joe Hankinson was unlucky not to take a wicket but had 2 maiden overs. Wicket keeper Kristian Otto was in fine form evidenced by a marvellous stumping and great run out. He also cleverly left an awesome throw from the boundary by Alex Morgan## which hit the stumps for yet another run out. The highlight of the evening was a brilliant and well-deserved hat trick by Thomas Brannigan. Amersham finished their innings with a total of 143 runs from 20 overs putting Ballinger in a very strong position. After some interesting and heart stopping batting from the opening pair (Kristian Otto and George Bartlett) Ballinger were on 212. The light was fading badly by now and dark rain clouds threatened when Adam Robinson and Tom Brannigan came into bat. This pair really got the scoreboard ticking## scoring lots of runs for no loss of wicket. Despite the rain and continued pressure from Amersham## Joe Hankinson and Oliver Lloyd continued to increase Ballinger's run rate losing only one wicket in their 4 overs. Sam King and Jeremy Steel put on a stand of 30 with Sam finding the boundary 6 times. The rest of the team cheered off the pair. Derek (the umpire) was never going to let bad light stop play with the team in this form and so Alex Morgan and George Bailey went out as the last pair in the gloom of the approaching night. The pair held their own and George was unlucky to be caught on the last ball by Amersham's star bowler. The final score Ballinger 306## Amersham 143. A well deserved win. Thanks to Derek Richards for coaching the team.,,2010-02-11
401,This match showed a big improvement by BWCC and we were always on top. A solid top of the order start from Hamish Elliott and Anthony Mousinho set the tone and useful contributions came from all batting pairs. Key to our decent total was the loss of only 4 wickets in our 20 overs## also the team were more forceful with their shots## selections were better whilst calling and running showed a major improvement - so well done! Useful contributions came from Dan Stockdale## Harry Rix & our Captain for the day James Rose to boost our total to 280. Defending their total BWCC got off to a good side with Beaconsfield finding it hard to score regularly## the match was effectively decided when Will Clark (1-1) and Harriet Stone (2-2) had their spells. They were very well followed by Hamish Elliott (1-2) plus two run outs off his bowling by Will Clark helped up our cause as BWCC picked up 7 wickets during the inning. Overall a very pleasing performance with some big improvements; harder hitting into the right areas## good calling## tighter bowling and very much better fielding with some good vocal encouragement. Well done everyone!,,2010-02-11
403,Hoping for two back-to-back league wins in two days we approached this match with confidence which was boosted when Winchmore Hill batted first and we made a run out from the first ball of their inning. However thereafter WH batted sensibly and lost only 3 more wickets in compiling a competitive 279. WH fielded three excellent batsman who hit the ball hard and choose their shots carefully. BWCC generally bowled well with improved accuracy but could not penetrate. There were bright moments however none better than when Luke Hughes held onto a full blooded pull to square leg - the best catch anyone had seen this season. Batting in failing light on a wet grass wicket on the edge the square meant that BWCC got the worst of the conditions and sadly things got worse from then! Our opening pair lost three wickets and we never got in touch with the run rate. In all we lost 11 wickets which made a huge difference to our run chase. In fairness BWCC improved towards the end of our inning with Will Clark and Harriet Stone adding 22 with no loss of wicket - showing that accumulating runs without losing wickets was possible!,,2010-02-11
406,This was a very comfortable victory for Ballinger. The team are now well organised and playing to their true potential. Luke Martin again batted well and was well supported by Dominic Hutson but all the boys contributed to a good team effort Top batsmen: Luke Martin 25; Dominic Hutson 20 not out Top bowlers: (forgot to write this down from scorebook - tba !!!!!!!!!),,2010-02-11
407,Ballinger Under 11A's turned in an extremely professional performance to beat a talented Winchmore Hill side. Winchmore Hill batted first to score 244 runs. Ballinger bowled extremely well to take 8 wickets. The pick of the bowlers were Adam Robinson## Sebastian Richards and Alex Morgan## each of whom took 2 wickets## ably supported by Joe Hankinson## George Bailey## Mathew Dunnington## George Bartlett and Jack and Max Maciver. Kristian Otto turned in another superb display of wicket keeping. In reply Ballinger Under 11A made 301 runs for the loss of just 2 wickets. Highlights included a ferocious opening stand of 42 runs between Jack Maciver and Kristian Otto. Kristian## in particular## played a superb attacking innings. Each of the remaining batsmen built on this fine start and the innings was completed with a fine flourish from the last pair of Adam Robinson and George Bartlett. Once again Jack Maciver displayed a mature grasp of his role as captain. This was a fine performance by Ballinger Under 11A's and all the boys were a credit to the club.,,2010-02-11
408,On the hottest afternoon of the year Ballinger played Farnham Royal in a crucial double header. We lost the toss but were put in to bat anyway so we were not too downhearted about that. We got off to a very steady start against a disciplined bowling attack## reaching 80 before losing a wicket after 13 overs## with Sam Phillips and Andrew Branigan both making 38. With so few wickets down we could afford to accelerate and did so in style making 73 off our last 7 overs with Olly Richards making a rapid 29 to finish on 153-8 off our 20 overs. In reply they started very positively getting to 93 off 15 overs for the loss of only two wickets. However they then collapsed after some fine bowling by Fergus Hardy## Andrew Branigan and Dan Camp to finish on 113-6. Fergus took 3 wickets including 2 in 1 over## Jono Lacey took 1 along with a couple of runouts. For most of the game this was a tense and exciting encounter.,,2010-02-11
410,On the hottest afternoon of the year Ballinger played Farnham Royal in a crucial double header. We lost the toss but were put in to bat anyway so we were not too downhearted about that. We got off to a very steady start against a disciplined bowling attack## reaching 80 before losing a wicket after 13 overs## with Sam Phillips and Andrew Branigan both making 38. With so few wickets down we could afford to accelerate and did so in style making 73 off our last 7 overs with Olly Richards making a rapid 29 to finish on 153-8 off our 20 overs. In reply they started very positively getting to 93 off 15 overs for the loss of only two wickets. However they then collapsed after some fine bowling by Fergus Hardy## Andrew Branigan and Dan Camp to finish on 113-6. Fergus took 3 wickets including 2 in 1 over## Jono Lacey took 1 along with a couple of runouts. For most of the game this was a tense and exciting encounter.,,2010-02-11
411,Ballinger and Little Gaddesden played out a slightly dull draw on Saturday. A very slow pitch made it difficult for both sides but having been asked to bat first Gaddesden made better use of it than Ballinger. Good running between the wickets enabled Gaddesden to get off to a good start and gave Ballinger's fielders chance to demonstrate their speed of thought and action. 2 quick wickets brought in danger man Barrington who was immediately dropped by skipper Riley. A rapid 34 by Barrington helped Gaddesden to 172. Late wickets by Adams and Davies prevented too much damage. When Ballinger batted Riley's day was made complete by getting a golden duck and BWCC were reduced to 7- 4. Only Humphreys## for Ballinger## was able to overcome the slow pitch with an excellent 57. He and Kerry added 50 for 7th wicket and looked as though a win was on but it was not to be and Ballinger ended on 125-9. BWCC 8pts Little Gaddesden 15pts.,,2010-02-11
413,On a beautiful evening Taplow won the toss and put Ballinger in to bat. Every one contributed with the bat and thanks to the loss of only two wickets and a contribution of 26 from the last pair; Jack Bugden and James Rose a good total of 273 was achieved. On the plus side no one was bowled out - the two wickets being an unusual caught behind off the back of the bat and a run out. The bowling display was good. Harry Rix and James Rose opened and both bowled with good pace each taking one wicket. Will Clark bowled some useful off cutters and took a wicket. Nick Bartington bowled a good spell taking two wickets in his second over. The last pair for Taplow were un done by some good spin bowling by Anthony Mourinho and the deadly accuracy of Harriet Stone who bowled two overs without conceding a run and took one wicket. There were two excellent run outs by Harry Rix and Harriet Stone. In total Ballinger took 8 wickets leaving Taplow on 224 at the end of their innings. So all in all a very encouraging win. Things to work on….. calling and running between the wickets and putting the bad ball away. Well done all the boys and girls who played.,,2010-02-11
415,Thursday 2nd June was a beautiful sunny evening at Ballinger. Unfortunately that was the only good thing about the evening. Marlow Park won the toss and asked the BWCC to bat. Even being 1 player short shouldn't have led to the catastrophe that then occurred as BWCC were bowled out for 15. Marlow scored the runs to win in 2.5 overs. Less the best me thinks.,,2010-02-11
417,Cancelled due to the building of Ark!,,2010-02-11
419,Pathetic was one of the milder words used to describe Ballinger's inept performance on Saturday. Having been asked to bat## the early signs looked promising for Ballinger but a combination of poor shot selection and running ensured a miserable day with the home side being all out for 73 in 28 overs. Broomwade's latest import was too good for Ballinger's middle order. An excellent catch by Kerry and a sharp stumping and catch by Fallowfield- Smith## all off Humphreys## gave Ballinger some hope but 73 was always going to be difficult to defend and Broomwade ended on 75 -3 off 15 overs. BWCC 1pt Broomwade 20pts.,,2010-02-11
420,The Lee won the toss and put Ballinger into bat. Ballinger's opening pair of Tom Edmonds (bowling captain) and Evan Webster batted with authority and put on 27 runs. Next pair Harry Wells and Robert Rose continued in the same positive way and put on 13 runs. Guyan and Rory then mixed defensive and adventurous batting to add a further 24 runs. Xavier and Andy had to cope with widely variable bowling but kept their heads to add 2 runs. The final pair Tom McIntyre and Tom Butterworth played some fine strokes and ran well adding a further 16 runs. 284 for 2. Ballingers fielding was excellent with every bowler taking wickets apart from Harry Wells who made up for it by taking 2 of the most stunning catches seen at any level of cricket. Tom McIntyre (fielding captain) kept wicket impeccable throughout. The Lee's final score of 208 for 11.,,2010-02-11
421,A bad weekend was completed at Ballinger when they were easily beaten by Albury Entertainers. . Batting first Ballinger were unable to capitalise on an excellent stand between Andy Branigan & Ian Davies both scoring 40s## collapsing from 90-2 to 136-10. Some sloppy fielding by Ballinger## apart from a brilliant run out by Davies## enabled Albury's opener Ellis to score 57 and they reached Ballinger's total for loss of just 2 wickets.,,2010-02-11
422,Ballinger Under11A's produced their finest performance of the season to defeat a strong Cublington Under 11 side. Particularly pleasing was the manner in which the side recovered from a difficult start to the innings. Ballinger batted first and the opening batsmen faced some aggressive and accurate bowling from Cublington which reduced Ballinger to 197 runs after 4 overs. Ballinger dug deep and produced a number of fine partnerships## Joe Hankinson and Sebastian Richards (23 runs)## Max Maciver and Mathew Dunnington (20 runs)## Alex Morgan and George Bailey (21 runs) and a final flourish from the two closing batsmen## Adam Robinson and George Bartlett (36 runs). This was a fine fightback by Ballinger and particular praise must be given to Max Maciver for his mature innings and to Adam Robinson for his aggressive batting at the end of the innings. Cublington## in reply## were restricted to 215 runs for the loss of 11 wickets by some tight Ballinger bowling. All the bowlers made significant contributions backed by another superb display of wicket keeping by Kristian Otto. Pick of the bowlers were the opening bowlers## Jack Maciver and Alex Morgan. Jack Maciver in particular bowled a superb hostile opening spell. Special mention must go to Mathew Dunnington who bowled superbly to take 4 wickets## including 3 wickets in one over. The day belonged to the whole team## each of whom made a vital contribution to the victory and the team was splendidly captained by Jack Maciver.,,2010-02-11
423,There were some unusual names in this U15 side## which included three U12s & one U13. It didn't make any difference## as Ballinger were still too strong for Wendover. Batting first a very composed innings of 42no from Nick Rose plus a brilliant innings of 33 from James Wood## in his first appearance for the U15s## helped Ballinger reach 126-4 off their 20 overs. Another new boy James Stoddart bowled a very tidy spell taking 2-18 but Fergus Hardy did most of the damage with a spell of 3-5. Wendover finally reached 109-8.,,2010-02-11
424,In another close fought encounter between these clubs Ballinger just squeezed home off the penultimate ball. Batting first Kingshill reached 130-5 thanks mainly to 61 no out by Major. Only Crick and Macdonald caused the Kingshill batsmen any problems taking 2 wickets each. Then Crick & skipper Charlie Wells opened up for Ballinger and paced their innings perfectly. Kingshill used 8 bowlers in an attempt to remove one of these two but to no avail and with the help of 29 extras## 68 from Crick & 34 from Wells Ballinger sneaked home.,,2010-02-11
425,Another comfortable victory for the boys although losing 6 wickets in chasing just 60 isn?t good for the coaches nerves but reaching Chesham's score in 15 overs helped soothe them. Some extraordinary wicket-keeping from James Wood with 2 catches## 2 run-outs and a stumping - great to have him back in the team after recovering from a broken collar-bone !! Best batsmen: Stefan Otto 25; Dominic Hutson 17 Best bowlers: Richard Wise 3 wickets## George Bartlett 3 wickets,,2010-02-11
427,This fixture was rescheduled to enable the Cup match against Tring Park to be played. Sadly we were unable to re-arrange it to fit in with tournament organiser's schedule and they called it an abandoned game.,,2010-02-11
429,Ballinger's woeful season continued at the weekend when they suffered another heavy defeat. Having asked Widmer End to bat it looked like they were going to have to chase a huge target when Widmer reached 130-3 with 20 overs to go. Then an excellent spell by Davies and 2 brilliant catches## by Whelan and Adams enabled Ballinger to bowl Widmer out for 182 in 37 overs. The extra overs should have been a bonus to Ballinger sadly all that happened was that Widmer had longer to bowl them out. A poor pitch didn't help Ballinger's efforts but all out for under 100 two weeks running is relegation material. BWCC 6pts WESM 25pts.,,2010-02-11
430,On Sunday Ballinger had a very enjoyable game against The Scuttlers. Batting first the Scuttlers quickly rattled up 199 - 4 with no Ballinger bowler able to make an impression. Jeremy Hunting led Ballinger's reply with 41 before being brilliant caught by Kerry. Davies (47) & McGowan (20) kept the score moving but a fine spell of bowling by Kerry kept them behind the clock. 175-9 was a good effort but BWCC can thank their umpire for staving off another defeat at the hands of the Scuttlers.  ,,2010-02-11
435,<p>A much changed U11B's batted first and started well## posting 216 for the first pair## but wickets then tumbled fast. In all 13 wickets fell## mostly to straight balls and lobbed catches. This was disappointing as we have practising playing each ball on its' merits and using our feet better. The team were a little low as we changed over and when we started fielding things improved quickly. We bowled straighter and fielded really well - Luke Hughes taking a great catch a short extra cover supported by a catch in the slips by Will Smith and a couple of test book run outs. After 16 overs we had taken 8 wickets and pegged Gt Kingshill back to under the 200 mark and any result was possible. Sadly the last Kingshill pair got after us a bit and our offensive fielding positions leaked a few runs - a good gamble that did not quite come off. All the same an exciting game with the result in the balance until the last over. Lessons learnt? Losing 6 runs from a lost wicket is expensive## so patience and concentration is as valuable as the big hits! We all agreed after the match that we would win next time!</p>,,2010-02-11
436,An unbeaten 70 by Jeremy Hunting got the Waggoners rolling again on Saturday. Ballingers bowlers did an excellent job of keeping Lacey Green down to 156-9## with wickets been spread between Lawson## Humphreys## Maciver & Lloyd. Then even the loss of Matt Riley## to yet another golden duck## and the high temperatures were unable to stop Hunting and Humphreys(51) passing Laceys score with nearly 12 overs to spare. BWCC 20pts Lacey Green 6pts.,,2010-02-11
438,<p>Two excellent spells of spin bowling were too much for Bledlow on Sunday. Fergus Hardy 4-31 &amp; Andy Branigan 3 -38 were well supported by Jono Lacey 1-7## Rhodri Webster 2-6 and a master class in tight bowling from Nick Adams. The 112 Bleldow scored was never going to be enough on a good track and Ballinger duly passed their score with 4 down. Two making their season debuts Tom Wells (27) &amp; Nick Rose (25) led the way with Rhodri Webster making it all look very easy.</p>,,2010-02-11

446,In a nail biter at Ley Hill on Saturday## Ballinger managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Asked to bat first Ballinger were soon in trouble on a difficult wicket but a typically gritty innings from skipper Riley (44) and another flamboyant knock from McIntyre (46) managed to dig BWCC out of trouble. Sadly the 169 Ballinger finally limped to was always going to be difficult to defend on such a small ground. A superb opening spell by Humphreys of 5-11 gave Ballinger some hope and reduced Hill to 44-5. Then a courageous 63 from Leadbetter put Hill back in it## but wickets were still falling and Ley Hill were 9 down going into the last over still needing 3 to win. A boundary off the first ball ended an exciting game. BWCC 8pts Ley Hill 20pts,,2010-02-11
448,An excellent bowling and fielding display by a young Ballinger side## including 5 catches by Rhodri Webster## wasn't enough to beat Penn Street on Sunday. By bowling Penn out for 140 it looked as though the Waggoners were in for an easy afternoon sadly their batting didn't match up to the bowling and they were dismissed for a disappointing 123. At on stage Ballinger were 52-5 and only a stand of 70 by skipper Davies and new boy Dom Birkby enabled Ballinger to get close.,,2010-02-11
450,Farnham Common batted first and made 199 during which Ballinger took 10 wickets. Pick of the bowlers were Charlie Mead and Joe Hankinson## each of whom took 2 wickets## and Jack Maciver who accounted for 3 wickets## They were well supported by Alex Humphrey and Sebastian Richards who each took a wicket apiece. Once again Kristian Otto showed what a good wicket keeper he has become. Ballinger replied with 343 runs for the loss of 5 wickets## of which the highlights were a superb display of hitting by Sam King who made an unbeaten 32 and an extremely classy innings at he death by George Bartlett who showed excellent technique in his unbeaten score of 29 runs. All the batsmen contributed in a typically aggressive batting display with Jack Maciver and Kristian Otto contributing 18 in their 4 overs## Joe Hankinson and Sebastian Richards18 runs in their 4 overs## Sam King and Charlie Mead making 41 runs in their partnership## George Bailey and Alex Humphrey contributing 27 runs and an excellent final partnership between George Bartlett and Alex Morgan of 39 runs. Congratulations to all the boys for their contributions during the 2005 league season.,,2010-02-11

455,This was incredibly exciting match to finish off the league season for the boys. Just to trying to get any match in last week was an effort with the continuous rain! However## with plan 13.f. in place from moving the game to Sunday and then back to the Friday again## we had a good strong team out. Gt Kingshill have won every single one of their U13 matches this season## so we knew we were going to be up against some really stiff competition.  GK had a particularly strong couple of batsmen## so I was particularly glad he had to retire at 30! They reached 125 for 8 wickets (2 great run outs) - our boys put up some splendid bowling: particularly James Stoddart with 3 wickets## and Richard Wise## Luke Martin and Dominic Hutson with 1 each. Only 14 extras given away (7 bowling## and 7 byes/leg byes). Our boys opened well## but the run rate was a slow## leaving a lot to do. Although we benefited from 31 extras (mostly byes)## it wasn't until James Wood joined Dominic Hutson at the crease## that things really started to get exciting. James batted in his usual expert way hitting 2 fours## and a magnificent 6 straight out of the grounds. Both James and Dominic scored 28 each before being bowled. Luke Martin did well on 10 runs## and Sam Privett on 8. James Stoddart and Richard Wise came in as the light was fading fast (miserable rain clouds)## and the scores were getting closer. Three runs were needed off the last ball to tie (in which case Ballinger would have won on wickets) - they managed to score 2 runs off the final ball## leaving Gt Kingshill to win by just 1 run !!!!!!!!! (Not dissimilar to the match the following day at Lords between England and Australia - down to the last ball## and just that tiny bit too much to do too late!) Well done boys - I'm proud of the way you have all played all season - you've been great fun to work with as always## and I've seen a huge improvement in the batting from everyone!!. Here's to next season when you all become proper U13's !!! Wendy.,,2010-02-11
456,BWCC found itself on the wrong end of another nail-biter against Hawridge on Saturday. Hawridge were put in on a damp pitch and through some excellent bowling particularly from Davies were reduced to 82 for 7. However the Hawridge tail “wagged” and scratched its way to 171 all out. The Ballinger top order made a poor start. Then coming in at number five## Ollie Richards made a brilliant 70 to get The Waggoner's into a winning position. With 9 down going into the last over## and only 3 runs## required any result was possible. Sadly a dramatic run out gifted victory to Hawridge thus spelling heartbreak for Ballinger for the second week in a row as they came up short by 1 run. BWCC 9pts Hawridge 25pts.,,2010-02-11
457,Another good fielding effort by this young side kept Longwick down to 140 in their 40 overs but once again the batting was poor and Ballinger were all out for 90.,,2010-02-11
458,A brutal innings of 72 from Jono Lacey smashed Ballinger into the final of the Bucks Cup on Wednesday. Jono denied to score singles choosing the more direct route of eleven 4s & three 6s. Ballinger had been given a steady start by openers Phillips & Lowe## who put on 44 for the 1st wicket## but when they went in quick succession and were followed unluckily by skipper Richards it was left to Lacey and Camp to destroy Buckingham. Their partnership of 94 in 8 overs was thrilling to watch and helped Ballinger to 165. Then Lacey## opening the bowling## produced a blistering spell of fast bowling taking 3 - 14 in 4 overs but the bowling plaudits really belong to Charlie Wells who mesmerised the Buckingham batsmen taking 4 - 21 in his 4 overs. Skipper Ollie Richards was very pleased with the team's performance and was looking forward to the final when Ballinger take on Burnham.,,2010-02-11

462,Ballinger scored a comfortable win over local rivals The Lee on Saturday. The Lee won the toss and decided to bat. An excellent opening spell of 3 for 17 from Tom Graham soon put The Lee on the back foot and their troubles continued as the spinners were introduced. A devastating spell of 5 for 5 by Ian Davies rolled The Lee over for a paltry 64. Ballinger were clinical as they set about cantering home before tea with skipper Matt Riley steering his team over the line with 26 not out. BWCC 25pts The Lee 1pt.,,2010-02-11

466,Ballinger had a comfortable win over bottom of the table Lt.Gaddesden on Sat. Having been put in Ballinger abstained from their normal crawl at the start of an innings and galloped to 50 off 10 overs with Kerry encouraging skipper Riley to run the occasional single. Once Kerry was out though the run rate really accelerated with Draper back to top form and scoring an excellent 102no. This plus 65 from Riley and a very rapid 41no from McIntyre took the Waggoners to 240-2. A wet ball prevented Ballinger's bowlers from ever really dominating but Lawson's 5 wickets and another tight spell of 2-11 from Humphreys was too much for the Gadd with them all out for 190. BWCC 25pts Little Gaddesden 5pts.,,2010-02-11
467,Ballinger completed an excellent weekend with a win over Chesham Bois. Batting first Chesham Bois were bowled out for 108 with off-spinner Fergus Hardy doing most of the damage with 4-17. Rhodri Webster guided Ballinger home with a well crafted 57 as the Waggoners reached 109-2.,,2010-02-11
468,Ballinger took on league leaders Broomwade on Saturday and current form suggested a heavy defeat for the Waggoners. Once again they confounded their critics by putting in an excellent bowling and fielding display which kept Broomwade down to 176. Ian Maciver## with his first 5 wicket haul of the season## led the way but he was well supported by some excellent catching## particularly by Whelan. Kerry made an important breakthrough when his under utilised off spin accounted for Broomwade's latest import. A little more ambition from Ballinger's early order batters may have helped the Waggoners get closer to Broomwade's score but Broom's excellent seam attack gave Ballinger no chance of causing an upset and they had to be happy to settle for a draw finishing on 128-5. BWCC 8pts Broomwade 14pts.,,2010-02-11
469,A strange event took place at Ballinger on Sunday when the Waggoners played Monks Risborough in a 40 over game. Agreeing to play a limited overs format has seen many captains hauled before the committee even though it may have been an away game but agreeing to play one at Ballinger could well be a flogging offence. The Club President## Gerry Hunting## who was at the ground to check out the offering of Ballinger's' latest recruit to the Tea Lady rota## was apoplectic and was telling anyone prepared to listen that it wouldn't have happened in his day. Fortunately no-one was prepared to listen. The game revolved around another excellent bowling and fielding display by this young Waggoners side who kept Monks to 193-10. Olly Lowe(3-34) and Tom Graham(3-37) bowled exceptionally well. Unfortunately skipper Davies allowed Ben Whelan 2 overs because it was his last game of the season. 34 runs later Davies realised that there's no place for sentiment in this game Ballingers reply started awfully with 3 wickets falling in the first 8 overs Davies and Wells batted well and a late flourish from Tom Graham and Alex MacDonald kept Ballinger up with the run rate but sadly they lost wickets too quickly and ended 22 runs short.,,2010-02-11
472,Ballinger eased their relegation worries on Saturday with a comfortable win over Lacey Green. Batting first the Waggoners reached 155 - 7 with the main contributions from Riley(32) & Davies (43no). Then expert use of the old ball by Maciver with 4-31 & Lawson 3-24 reduced the Green to 79-8. Two balls with the new ball was all that Adams needed to finish off the tail with Lacey Green 83-10. BWCC 25pts Lacey Green 4pts,,2010-02-11
473,Ballinger were invited to bat first against The Minn on Sunday a decision their skipper probably regretted when the Waggoners' openers Webster & Phillips added 121. This was followed by a rapid 23 from Richards and a stand of 70 between Davies (50no) & Tivey (25no) enabling Ballinger to declare on 240-3. Despite a spell of 3-0 in 4 overs from skipper Davies## Ballinger were unable to winkle out the Minn batters and they finished on 149-6.,,2010-02-11
474,BWCC fielded a very much under strength side supplemented by a number of colts (3 of which were asked to play 5 minutes before the start of the game). However## those asked to feature in the top 4 all contributed with the bat## even the somewhat elevated No. 3 James Fallowfield-Smith who chipped in with a useful 20!! Openers Humphries and Riley scored at nearly 5 an over before Humphries became the fist of 3 wickets for Lown who claimed all of the top 3. Davies looked to push the score along and looked set for a big score before being brilliantly caught on the long-off boundary by a guy who (he was reliably informed) had not taken a catch all season## his innings ending on 29. N. Adams then “joined” the party walloping the opening bowler back over his head for two huge sixes and finished 20 not out. In reply BWCC's miserly opening pair immediately removed the top three without greatly troubling the scorers. Ley Hill's numbers 4 and 5 however had other ideas looking to bat positively and scored at a rapid rate before Davies struck twice to remove both. Ley Hill were always in the hunt after this## scoring at the required rate before Lawson produced a masterclass in slow left arm bowling to mop up the rest of the side finishing on 5 - 37 with the Hill trailing by 44 runs. BWCC 25pts Ley Hill 6pts.,,2010-02-11
475,Another fine display of bowling and fielding from Ballinger's youthful Sunday side saw Wendover dismissed for a low score of 128 on a good batting wicket. Davies and Hardy did most of the damage bowling 19 overs between them and taking 6 - 37## before Crick and Kellog came on to mop up the tail. Chris Mitchell## making his senior debut behind the stumps## took an excellent catch off Crick. In reply Andy Branigan batted solidly for his 44 before being stumped## while Kellok flailed his bat for a quickfire maiden half century for the club (It had to be quickfire as a severe case of cramp set in after running one too many 3's!!). BWCC suffered a mini collapse shortly before the end (similar to the game being played at Trent Bridge## ironically with the same target to chase) but the experienced I. Hardy saw the Waggoner's home with 5 wickets to spare.,,2010-02-11
476,Ballinger's U15s ended their season in style with a comfortable win over Beaconsfield in the league Cup final last week.. Batting first a good team effort enabled them to reach 123-6## with the main contributions coming from Lowe## Crick & Camp. Then tight bowling and excellent fielding enabled skipper Richards to keep the pressure on the Beaconsfield batsmen with only Rory Mcarthy (50) making any impression in their total of 90-6. Coach Nigel Kerry said the boys were disappointed to lose to Burnham in the BCB Cup final## so were even more determined to end the season on a high. Team - Ollie Richards## Charlie Wells## Fergus Hardy## Richard Page## Ollie Lowe## Sam Phillips## Dan Camp## Chris Mitchell## Jason Stone## Nick Rose## Tom Crick & Andy Branigan. Coaches Nigel Kerry & Ian Hardy,,2010-02-11
477,An unusual occurrence happened at Hawridge on Saturday when Ballinger's league season ended with an enjoyable game against their local rivals. Batting first Hawridge reached 244 - 6 off their 45 overs thanks## in some part to 8 dropped catches## and an excellent innings by Rifai (68). Will Hunting was a man in a hurry scoring 51 in 25 minutes to give the Waggoners the start they needed he was helped by another belligerent innings from Mcintyre (61) but only Adams (25) of the later batsman could cope with the spin of Rifai. It went to the wire though with the Waggoners being bowled out for 209 in the 45 over. BWCC 8pts Hawridge 25pts,,2010-02-11
478,Sunday's game at Ballinger belonged to the Birkby brothers. An excellent catch by skipper Kerry set elder brother Dominic on the way to his first 5 wicket haul (6-44) in senior cricket. He was well supported by some excellent ground fielding & a sharp spell (2-25) from Fallowfield-Smith with Fulmer ending on 171-10. Salisbury (50) & Fallowfield-Smith (45) set about this target with great gusto but it was Ali Birkby (26*)## making a guest appearance## who led the Waggoners home in style.,,2010-02-11
479,Winning the toss and batting first is the usual ploy on Sundays but on a damp wicket in September against a strong Beaconsfield side it may not be the right decision and so it proved on Sunday. Only opener Riley(26) and Andy Branigan(44) were able to make any progress and Ballingers final score of 148 always looked to few. When Beaconsfield batted the Waggoners were looking for some early wicket from Adams. He duly obliged but unfortunately it brought in Carter who proceeded to smash the Ballinger bowlers to all parts of Beaconsfield. His 84 helped Beaconsfield pass Ballinger's total in just 21 overs. The only high point for Ballinger was the rare appearance in the scorebook of “ Bowled Hardy - Stumped Riley” ,,2010-02-11

555,On a beautiful early autumn afternoon Ballinger started their last match 2 short. Team secretary Kerry was heard cursing email/mobiles/BT and colts in no particular order. Fortunately Ali Birkby was on hand to fill one of the slots again. Perhaps we ought to pay Chesham a transfer fee for him. Batting first on a very difficult wicket The Waggoners were soon in trouble when Hunting was brilliant caught in the gulley. Riley& Davies followed shortly and it was left to Maciver(44) and Kerry(25) to rebuild the innings. Another brilliant knock by Birkby(34) helped by a battered Kellock helped the Waggoners reach 161-5. Penn St set off in a very positive manner but Ballinger's spinners soon held sway with Fergus Hardy bowling a marathon spell of 19 overs taking 5-70. He was helped by Davies(3-21) & Maciver (2-4) and Penn were bowled out for 121. A very pleasant end to the season.,,2010-02-11
556,This was a very strange game. It looked likely at one stage that Ballinger were going to dismiss the Weekenders relatively cheaply but then their No6 played an extraordinary innings during which he played and missed## heaved and missed## heaved and hit and somehow ended up with 86*. Skipper Davies used seven bowlers all to no avail and the Weekenders finished on 226 - 5. Rick Brockett(21) & Jeremy Hunting(27) gave the Waggoners a good start but it was Davies(74) who took the attack to the opposition. Then the light deterioted so much that umpires Hunting & Hunting had to ask the opposition to bowl their slow bowlers if they wanted to continue the game. Unfortunately Davies decided to keep hitting these bowlers for 4s so the Weekenders brought back their quickies at which point amid much grumbling the umpires called a halt.

169,<p>Only 3 overs were possible at a very soggy Ballinger . In some corners this was greeted with sighs of relief as 8pts may have been more than the team would have achieved against a strong Broomwade side</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
168,<p>On the opening day of the season Ballinger were greeted with an excellent track## a short boundary and an Aldenham side short of bowlers. Rollo McIntyre took full advantage of all this and bludgeoned 120n.o. in no time. He added 206 for the second wicket with Matt Riley. Riley scored 70 at a more stately speed. Ballinger declared on 218 - 2 with only skipper Salisbury missing out.</p><p>Aldenham's batting was some-what better than their bowling and with the track still playing well they reached 190-7. All the Ballinger bowlers performed well but it was particularly pleasing to see the spin duo## Davies & Hardy## bowling well in tandem. New 'keeper Riley did an excellent job behind the sticks.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
107,<p>They don't come any closer than this! Ballinger win a cliff hanger of a cup game against Flackwell Heath.</p> <p> Flackwell batted first and were contained by a tidy opening spell by Luke Hughes and Charlie Mead. At the mid point of the 20 overs they accelerated but were then pegged back towards the close of their innings by two good spells by James Rose and Sebastian Richards who each bowled two overs and took two wickets for 5 runs. At the close Flackwell had scored 60. However the grass in the outfield was very long and we reckoned that it was worth 80 to 90 at our ground.</p><p>Ballinger lost Alex Humphreys early to a very good catch. George Bailey and George Kinston then both batted well and gave us a good base. They were both dismissed for 11## which on a better outfield would have been worth a lot more. Charlie Mead came in at second wicket down and batted really well to accumulate 25. Ballinger were well on course until Charlie was out and then the middle order lost composure as the run chase was reaching its climax.</p> <p> The light was poor as the last over was bowled with Ballinger still needing two to win. A wicket fell and Matthew Rose joined Sebastian Richards at the crease. A dot ball was followed by a scampered single (encouraged from a rather vocal square leg umpire!). Basty was now on strike. Three balls left one run to win. Two dot balls. One delivery left - one run required. The tension was mounting. Basty middled a leg stump delivery which went crashing past mid on and Ballinger had won.</p> The team bowled and fielded well. Next match we need to cut down on the opposition's singles and scramble a few more of our own. All in all a very credible performance by the team with every one contributing with either bat or ball and in the end a thoroughly deserved victory.Paul Rose,Nigel,2010-03-08
110,<p>On a beautiful spring evening BWCC U11A's got off to a disappointing start to the season. Playing off 22yards!! </p>Ballinger put Beaconsfield in to bat and they took full advantage of the difficulty some bowlers were having bowling on a longer than usual pitch and were rattling up the runs. They were helped by some some beginning of the season sloppy fielding & after their 20 overs they were 273 for 4 with Tom Edmonds getting 8 for 32 off 2 overs. Will Smith kept really well.</p><p>After the first 2 pairs we were only 4 runs behind but our inability to pierce the field meant when the last pair came in they needed to make 38 runs in 4 overs. This proved an impossible task.</p><p>We need to put this behind us and in the next match## ensure our fielding is up to Ballingers usual standard## bowl a good length and look for the gaps in the field to get boundaries.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
102,<p>When the teams arrived at the ground the game was in doubt due to a wet out-field and light rain. However the 2 team coaches agreed to start the game and review the situation after 3-4 overs. The game was played under Barrington rules and Amesham won the toss and asked BWCC to bat first. Once the game was underway the weather improved immensely and soon the sun was shining and the outfield was not as slippery as we thought it might be. </p> <p> The BWCC opening pair gave the team a steady start despite loosing an early wicket. Subsequent pairs batted sensibly and carefully and kept the score ticking over. The final pair scored 26 runs to set a target of 265 runs. In total BWCC lost 5 wickets. There was good batting performances from Jamie Wise## Josh Livingstone## Monty Cuthbert## Alex Welsh and Joe Carey. </p> <p>When Amersham batted## the BWCC bowlers bowled a very good line and length and prevented Amersham from scoring too many runs. The BWCC fielding was excellent with good backing-up from the players plus lots of encouragement from each boy to their team members. The BWCC bowlers conceeded many fewer extras than the Amersham bowlers. </p> <p> What was particularly pleasing was that only one bye and only 3 additional runs from wide deliveries were conceeded - well done to Alex Wills for keeping wicket so well. In the end BWCC only took 3 wickets - 2 in the final over. However their overall bowling performance restricted the Amersham batsmen.</p> <p>Josh Livingstone captained the side well and all the team members accepted his field placings without question. There were good bowling performances from Max Bailey## who took all 3 wickets## Duncan Healey## Eddie Bentley## Tom Harrison and John Martin.</p> <p>I would like to thank Jeff Moxom for umpiring the match - with the permission of Amersham CC officials.</p> <p>Finally all the boys behaved impeccably and were a credit to the club.</p> <p>Thanks to all the parents for suppporting the boys.</p> <p>Chris Moxom BWCC Coach.BWCC 264-5 Amersham 235-3,Chris,2010-03-08
165,<p>The game started on a damp Sunday morning. There was a slight mix-up with the times in that Aston Clinton thought the game started at 10. However the match proceeded as soon as possible and Aston Clinton won the toss and asked BWCC to bat.</p> <p> Stephan Otto and George Barlett opened the batting and proceeded to make steady progress against the very good Aston opening bowlers. Stephan and George put on 23 in 7 overs before George was out for 7. James Wood came in at number 3.. </p> <p>Sadly## as the match progressed## the strip become much more slippery and it began to cut-up. The home umpire proposed that the game be abandoned because of the potential risk of injury to both bowlers and batsmen. After a brief discussion between the coaches of both teams it was agreed to abandon the game. </p> <p>At this point Stephan was 11 not out and James 6 not out. All three BWCC batsmen had batted very well in the difficult conditions. </p> <p>The full team wasStephan Otto## George Barlett## James Wood## Jeff Moxom## James Miller## Jack MacIver## Luke Martin (capt.)## Jonny Freeman## Aaron Bailey## Michael Bryant## Richard Wise.BWCC U14 29-1 (9 overs),Chris,2010-03-08
114,High Wycombe proved too strong for us on Thursday evening. Wycombe batted first and were restricted to 32 off their first 10 overs## however## they accelerated to reach 83 for 4 after 20. All the bowlers bowled well and kept their heads when confronted by some clean striking of a cricket ball by some of the Wycombe batsmen. The fielding was also of a good standard and to limit a side with a number of county players to 83 in 20 overs was a very commendable performance. Will Clarke and George Bailey both bowled 3 over and took 1 for 7## which was an excellent analysis on an evening made for batting.Unfortunately we struggled with the bat. The opposition were quick and pretty straight## which proved a lethal combination for most of our players. Sam King put up some good resistance and scored 9. James Rose showed a commendably good technique and occupied the crease without adding much to the score. We were eventually bowled out for 33. I would be surprised if we come up against a bowling attack as good as that again this season. Having said that## we need to look closely at our basic technique## ie getting in line and playing straight to straight balls.There is no need to feel disheartened by defeat to a very competent opposition. And the boys now go on to a league match at Amersham followed by cup game at home to Beaconsfield on Monday 15th May.Paul Rose,Paul,2010-03-08
103,<p>With a school game at The Beacon not due to finish until 6.30## Ballinger had no choice but to start the game with 5 players (including 2 subs.) which had a major impact on the batting order. This was no way to start a game against a strong Chesham side including several county players. Chesham sportingly agreed that Ballinger should bat first on a wicket with variable bounce and a great deal of sideways movement. 100 would have been a good score.</p><p>The first few overs were negotiated safely until the wicket's variable bounce played its part in accounting for the first two wickets. Adam clipped his 2nd ball over the deep square boundary and Alex & Tom (Watts) mixed good defence with sensible attaching shots. The score was on 31 after 12 overs & acceleration was needed. Woody and Stefan led the way with George & Kristian playing their part. Somehow we managed to scrape our way to 82.</p><p>Luke & Richard opened the bowling against as good a batsman as they will play against all season. Both gave it everything. Looking for inspiration Stefan then turned to James “golden arm” Stoddart who opened up with a double wicket maiden including the prize scalp - great catch by Stefan. Jack produced 4 tidy economical overs## picking up 1 wicket and Ballinger were now back in it. Ballinger kept up the pressure with the excellent ground fielding all the way through. 26 off 6 needed & the Chesham batsmen (and coaches) were starting to feel the pressure. Great catch by Luke followed by an equally good run out by Woody & the pressure continued to mount. George## now into his rhythm picks up 2 quick wickets. Kristian## Tom Sperring & Callum continued to set the example in the field & two runs are needed off the last ball. Unfortunately Chesham managed to scrape home in the dark.</p><p>Summary.Under the circumstances this really was a great team effort and hopefully everyone who played now knows they can compete (and beat) anyone they play against. On difficult wickets## against good quality bowling## patience is needed. We have to play straight. Extras on both sides were top score so the need to bowl straight (especially on this type of wicket) is key to defending a total.</p><p>A special mention to Tom S. & Callum. Your attitude & team spirit set the tone. Stefan## captaincy wise## that's as hard as it will get!</p> <p>Team: Stefan Otto## James Woods## Luke Martin## Richard Wise## James Stoddart## Jack Maciver## Callum Bright## Tom Sperring## Kristian Otto## George Bartlett## Adam Robinson.Subs - Alex Morgan## Tom Watts</p>,Ian,2010-03-08

118,<p>A determined and focused U13A team eased into the second round of the cup overcoming Gt. Kingshill. </p><p>On a damp and dreary Sunday morning Ballinger were put in after losing the toss. Sam Privett and Stefan Otto batted solidly to see off the dangerous Kingshill opening bowlers with Sam being a little unlucky to be run out. </p><p>Following the departure of the openers James Wood produced some beautifully timed drives on his way to 16. Luke Martin scored some quick fire runs before hitting all round a straight one and Tom Sperring batted well to reach double figures before smashing a drive straight to a Kingshill fielder who did well to hang on given the cold and damp conditions. At 66-5 off 14 overs though## Kingshill must have had hopes of restricting Ballinger to a reasonable score. James Stoddart however produced his best innings for Ballinger for some time mixing excellent strokeplay with intelligent running between the wickets. Well assisted by Jack MacIver and Tom Watts they pushed the score on to 102 after 20 overs. </p><p>The Kingshill reply started briskly reaching 26-0 after 4 overs. This was largely due to both Jack and Richard struggling with their footing. The introduction of James Stoddart brought immediate success (again!) bowling Kingshill's best batsman and along with Sam who bowled an excellent line and length pegged back the Kingshill reply with only 15 runs coming off their 8 overs. Off a shortened run up Jack still managed to fizz one past the edge of the batsman's bat with James Wood completing the dismissal with a good catch behind the wicket. Richard managed to conjure up an amazing run out hitting the stumps from out by the boundary. If the Kingshill batsman were hoping for some respite they didn't get it as Adam Robinson bowled quick and straight to finish off the tailenders. The bowlers were well supported in the field with Callum Bright and Tom Watts in the thick of the action. </p><p>Stefan again captained the team well## leading from the front and always giving encouragement and assistance to the team along with making sure the ball was as dry as possible for his bowlers! </p><p>In the end a comfortable win built on sensible batting## all the bowlers bowling a good line and length backed up by some solid fielding. </p><p>Scorecard:<br><b>Ballinger 102 for 6</b> (James Stoddart 16*## James Wood 16## Stefan Otto 12## Tom Sperring 10)</p><p><b>Gt Kingshill 58 all out</b> (Adam Robinson 3-2-3-3## James Stoddart 4-1-8-3## Sam Privett 4-2-7-1)</p>,Ian,2010-03-08
172,Taplow 168 - 4 (Declared)<br>Ballinger 169 - 8 <p>Ballinger captain## Ian Maciver## won the toss and decided to field on an overcast## muggy day at Taplow. Openers Lloyd and McNeil made good use of the conditions to bowl very tight opening spells## the batsmen finding it hard to score off the swinging ball. Lloyd was first to make a breakthrough with a diving catch off his own bowling (fortunately not followed by the 'twang' of breaking hip replacement components)## he also took the second wicket with a ball that surprised the batsmen by swinging right round his legs and striking leg stump. The openers were supported admirably by some fine bowling from Colts Stone## Hughes and Maciver Jnr (4 overs## 3 maidens) and a nine over spell of off-spin from Maciver Snr. The Taplow run-rate was not allowed to accelerate until after their no.4's solid inning of 53 was ended in the safe hands of Maw off the bowling of McNeil. This brought on Taplow's big-hitting no.5 who struck a quickfire 28 before skying one to Maciver Snr off Ballinger debutant Johnson. Taplow's innings ended with a score of 168 declared## at tea. </p><p>Ballinger's innings started steadily with both openers going for less than 10. Nos. 4 and 5 helped accelerate the scoring but both also went cheaply; McNeil swiping and missing a slow## looping full-toss which he thought would be called a no-ball## and possibly should have been## harmless though it was . . . except for hitting the stumps. This brought on Maciver Snr who## in a partnership of 67 with Kellock## helped steady the ship and put Ballinger in a position to take the game to Taplow. Kellock's solid knock of 54 ended with an acrobatic one-handed catch deep in the outfield. Maciver Snr was next to go## falling just short of his half century on 47. The game was left delicately poised with a handful of overs left to bowl and Ballinger 24 runs from victory. Phil Lloyd did the rest## along with a couple of low scoring tail-enders## Lloyd striking the ball imperiously to the boundary## including the only six of the game and the winning runs## a four off the first ball of the last over of the match. </p><p>A game played in beautiful surroundings## on a very fine wicket and in the true spirit of Sunday cricket was enjoyed equally (almost) by both teams. </p>MACIVER I(Captain) <br>KELLOCK(Wicket Keeper) <br>STONE<br>LLOYD<br>JOHNSON<br>MAW<br>McNEIL<br>MACIVER J<br>HUGHES K<br>HUGHES L<br>TIVEY,Jamie,2010-03-08

214,<p>Ballinger won the toss and decided to field first. Amersham got off to a flying start racing to 44-1 in 7 overs. Will Clark taking the wicket## which was well caught by Sam King. Amersham's opening batsman retired on 30. Captain James Rose took 2-13 (1 of these a very good caught and bowled) and James Butterworth had figures of 2-11 the second wicket a brilliant catch from Alex Humphrey## which put us back in the game. Then Charlie Mead came back to bowl and took 2-4 in his second spell to restrict Amersham to 103.</p> <p>We started our reply from a steady opening base from Alex Humphries (6) and James Rose (5) but both of those were out in quick succession leaving Charlie Mead and Sam King. They batted well for a couple of overs but then Charlie was unfortunate to be caught by a very good slip catch. Sam King and Robbie Branfield decided to attack the bowlers and crashed the ball to the boundaries## which gave Ballinger a glimmer of hope. When Sam King retired on 31 Robbie continued for about 4 overs before being caught for 12. Daniel Stockdale and Will Clark were both out quickly and we finished 28 short of Amersham ending on 75.</p>Team J.Rose (Capt.) A. Humphrey G. Kingston## C. Mead## S. King## R. Branfield## D.

171,<p>Ballinger and Ley Hill fought out another nail biter at LHCC on Saturday Batting first the Waggoners struggled to 167-9 with only skipper Matt Riley showing any form on a slow pitch.</p> <p>New opener Andy Branigan and Riley looked in no trouble but found it difficult to get the ball away. McIntyre's introduction at the fall of the first wicket soon upped the scoring until he was dismissed by a clever bit of ball juggling by the Hill's gulley fielder. A brief flurry from Davies and a turgid innings from Kerry meant another failure by Ballinger's middle order. Adams then came to the rescue with 25 off 10 balls and with a bit of help from the tail 167 was riches indeed.<p/><p>Skipper Riley then pulled off a master-stroke when he opened the bowling with Maciver. His left arm spin was very difficult to attack and with Adams as miserly as ever at the other end the Hill found runs equally difficult to acquire.</p><p>Slowly but surely Ballingers spin trio of Maciver## Davies and Lawson tightened their grip on the game but with the Hill's Rennard now in full flow would they be able to get the required run rate high enough to overcome the inevitable late charge.</p><p>Wickets were beginning to fall as the pressure built but slowly the Hill got closer and closer. Danger man Leadbetter was removed by Adams but then Rennard took 11 off Adams penultimate over. This left him on strike and only 14 needed off the last 2 overs. Lawson concede 8 off his last over and now the game had swung in the Hill's favour. The Hill were now on 162 for 6 needing just 6 to win off the last over. Adams to bowl. The first ball had Nick Lee caught at cover## 1 run off the second brought Rennard on strike then the stroke of luck that changes games. Having batted serenely for his 72 Rennard played on.</p><p>5 now required off 3 balls. A scampered single## then a 2 meant 2 required off the last ball. A good clean hit sent the ball steepling into the dark evening night## a roar went up from the Ley Hill crowd only to be stilled when Kerry calmly moved into position to take the catch.</p>A really good game of cricket## enjoyed by both sides.LHCC 166-9 BWCC 167-10,Nigel,2010-03-08
109,H+C very graciously played us## although expecting us the night before! It was a good win to start the season## although extras played a large part on both sides. Best batting and bowling performance was by Xavier Owen (batting: 10 for 0## bowling 9 for 2).,Dick,2010-03-08
111,A tougher match against keen opposition ended with a narrow victory. Josh Livingstone and Xavier Owen both gained 2 wickets with excellent tight bowling and Harry Glenister achieved a wicket maiden.In the batting Alex Wills stood out with a splendid 19 for 1 (net 13 runs). Of 6 wickets lost 3 were to runouts and poor communication between the wickets## something to improve on in the future. A good cup win. Onwards!BWCC 36 for 6## Wendover 10 for 9.,Dick,2010-03-08
116,"""Match played on Sun 14th May. Although BWCC lost we were highly praised for our excellent cricket and spirited stand against a very good team by the opposition coach and spectators. Despite facing County bowlers we were unphased and had so many big hits not got to hand it could have been a very different story! Excellent batting performances by all## notably Tom Harrison (14 for 0## net 14)and a confident opening by Rory Seekins in the batting (9 for 0## net 9) as well as the wicket keeping## holding onto a low catch behind the stumps on their first ball.Harry Wells picked up 2 wickets for 11 runs and Jake Cutter the off cutter took a wicket on his first spinny ball! Toby King and Rory also clean bowled 2 batsmen.Communication between the wickets was excellent## in the future we can work on improving our field placement## as despite the Captains instructions fielders crept closer to the wickets and were not always in their optimum position despite clear """"favoured strokes"""" by the batsmen.The side was ably captained by Josh Livingstone## Alex Wills bowled very well (6 for 0)batted very well (10 for 1 net 4) and kept well## Xavier bowled in the very tight way we have come to expect!(3 for 0).

212,Ballinger U13 B's v Beaconsfield15th May 2006On Monday evening## despite heavy threatening skies the U 13B's took on a strong Beaconsfield U13's in a cup game. As has been the case with a number of our fixtures this year we were up against a lot of boys who were a year older## which## at this age makes quite a difference. Beaconsfield batted first and were kept in check by a good opening spell by Jack Hankinson and Luke Hughes. Mid innings acceleration lifted them to a total of 104. The highlight from Ballinger's point of view was a magnificent over from Jack towards the end of the innings which began with a wicket## clean bowled## was followed by two fast dot balls## followed by a wicket and then another wicket as a result of a great one handed catch by Sam King. Jack was now on hat trick and had a good shout for an LBW turned down## to complete a triple wicket maiden. Tom Branigan## in his first outing also bowled well and took two wickets.Ballinger batted against good straight bowling and never## with the exception of James Rose who showed a very good technique## got to grips with the Beaconsfield attack. We were dismissed in the 20th over for 48.The boys and girls need to have the more experience against the hard ball and work hard on their batting. The odds are always going to be a bit against them this season when up against clubs fielding only effectively an 'A' team## but hopefully this will provide good experience and practice for next year when most of the team will still be eligible for U13's cricket.Team: G.

122,Wendover 189 for 10 BWCC 230 for 10.A good win## with very consistent bowling by all## exceptional figures from Harry Wells (4 wickets for 3 runs) against their better batsmen## Robert Rose (2 for 3) Alex Howe (2 for 1) and Joe Carey (2 for 8). Robert and Alex both bowled wicket maidens. Rory Seekins and Jake Cutter bowled excellent spin and were unlucky not to get results. Only 7 extras (14 runs) were conceded.Jamie Wise led the batting with an excellent 19 for 0. Joint 2nd highest scores were Joe and Daniel Cady (both 9 for 0). Everbody scored runs although too many balls were skied (and caught). Luckily some lapses in running between the wickets with the associated poor calling went largely unpunished.The fielding was of a high standard with a fantastic diving catch from Alex Wills in the slips## 2 catches from Rory and 1 from Robert. Euan Jackson was particularly good in the field with a very good eye for the ball. Joe conceded no byes in his 10 overs keeping## Rory only 1.,Dick,2010-03-08
121,<p>Ballinger played High Wycombe on Thursday and just for once the sun shone. Unfortunately this might have been one of those occasions when a downpour might have been a saviour.</p><p> Batting first Ballinger's main hope was not to let their score go below 100 which they just managed by 8 runs. All the team tried their hardest## especially first timer Charlie Rodwell## but they were no match for Wycombe's accurate bowling.</p><p> The Waggoners then has to try and limit Wycombe's strong batting line up to under 300.

108,The 15s made a sound start to their league campaign against strong local rivals Chesham. Batting first against a side containing several county players BWCC lost an early wicket when Richard Clarke was out LBW before Charlie Wells and Ollie Richards steadied the innings. Charlie was the second out## to another LBW decision## with a useful score of 19## bringing in Tom Crick to join skipper Ollie who## having opened his innings with five singles## began to find the boundary. With Tom scoring exclusively in ones## Ollie pushed the score along well until he was out to a brilliant one-handed catch by Andy Goddard off the talented Ali Birkby for 31. Chesham's joy at dismissing Richards was short-lived## however## when Alex Macdonald struck his first ball for four and his second for six## Birkby's first over gaining a wicket but having gone for 19. Alex had found his timing straight away and raced to 30 in only nine scoring shots before being caught. Nick Rose and James Woods added useful## quick runs as the innings drew to a close with a score of 125## probably a few short## given the dominance enjoyed in the middle of the innings.Chesham's top three were all county players and it was important to bowl tightly early on## which Tom and Alex managed## but it was a change of bowling which gained the first wicket when Andy Goddard## playing for the off-spin## was deceived by a perfectly pitched top-spinner from Fergus Hardy. Jason Rance was then dropped first ball off a difficult low chance to square leg. Tight bowling and athletic fielding kept Chesham below the run rate required as they managed only six boundaries in total. James Woods kept tidily and took a neat stumping off Charlie and Tom Crick came back at the end to pick up two wickets including that of Ali Birkby who top-scored with 40. Chesham finished on 87 never having matched BWCC's run-rate in the face of a good all-round bowlingperformance; Tom and Alex being the pick with 2 for 6 and none for eight respectively## both off four overs. Thomas Maw## Jason Stone## in the outfield## and Jeff Moxom distinguished themselves in a very tidy fielding performance for the first match of the season.,Ian H,2010-03-08

125,<p>Amid## steady drizzle we assembled at Flackwell and after a delay we started a reduced length 16 over a side match in what was now steady rain.</p><p>We lost the toss and fielded## a decision that backfired on Flackwell as Jack Hankinson## fresh after bowling a triple wicket maiden with his last over against Beaconsfield bowled the best best spell our team have seen this Spring. His four overs yielded 4 wickets for two runs and he was supported by Freddie Gamble who was economic and took a wicket. Luke Hughes took over from Jack and took a wicket with his first ball## leaving Flackwell at a vunerable 19-6 after 9 overs.</p><p>The ball soon resembled a bar of soap and Flackwell re-grouped well to finish on 49-7 from their 16 overs## almost half their total comprised of extras due largely to the wet ball and terrible conditions.</p><p>After further rain (it never stopped) the Umpires agreed that the game could not continue and as this was the last permitted day to play the match the points were shared. This was a frustration to all of the players however they can be congratulated for sticking at a tough job and playing themselves into a position of strength.</p>Tim Rix,Nigel,2010-03-08
167,On a wet## windy and gloomy evening the match at Aston Clinton went ahead thanks to the home side's willingness to play. Aston won the toss and elected to bat but were almost immediately in trouble when BWCC's opening pair of Richard Clarke and Ollie Richards both struck## to leave the home side on 5 for 4 after three overs## good catches in the gully/point region being taken by Richard Wise and Richard Clarke off his opening partner. Although Aston worked hard to improve their score## the BWCC bowlers## using the conditions well## never let them back into the match. Richard Wise## looking quite at home in the older age group## picking up 2 for 8 off his four overs and Freddie Cooke bowling what turned out to be Aston's last man coming in at No. 8. James Stoddart and Dominic Hutson missed out## having been kept back to complete the allotted overs## as skipper Ollie was unaware that Aston were fielding a depleted side.Aston were always going to have difficulty defending a total of 33 and so it proved## BWCC overtaking their score half-way through the fourth over## as Ollie realised the priority of winning the match as soon as possible in the threatening conditions rather than risk giving more of the team batting time.Great credit went to the younger players## who enabled BWCC to fulfil the fixture (and pick up the league points) with only five U15s and fielded with the athleticism and enthusiasm that## together with their vocal support## is becoming their trademark.,Ian H,2010-03-08
124,The U13A's were beaten by the weather on a miserable sunday morning. Despite the oppostion appearing reluctant to make a start the game finally got under way.

123,The U14's came up against a very good Dinton side. The match was played in overcast conditions with rain not far away. BWCC won the toss and decided to bat first - perhaps not the best decision. Within the first 3 overs 4 of the top order were back in the pavillion with 4 runs between them - a disastrous start. James Miller and Jonny Freeman steadied the innings and put some runs on the board. James top scored with 19 runs. Wickets then started to fall regularly as the game progressed. However the U14's managed to bat out the 20 overs## with Chris Coldwell being undefeated on 7. Dinton made short work of the 57 runs required to win losing only 1 wicket due to a good catch by Michael Bryant of the bowling of Jack MacIver. As Dinton progressed towards the target a number of catches were offered but none went to hand.

166,The match was played on a very pleasant sunny evening. BWCC won the toss and asked Winslow to bat. Winslow made a good start but some good bowling by Jack MacIver and Luke Martin soon got among the wickets to peg Winslow back. The turning point for BWCC came when Alex Morgen took 3 wickets in his second over and ended with figures of 3-1-6-4 - well done Alex. As the final overs came## Winslow increased their score as BWCC tried to take the last wicket. BWCC were set a stiff target of 96 to win and sadly lost an early wicket. However Tom Sperring and Luke Martin steadied the innings. When Tom was out for 11## James Miller came to the wicket and the game turned again towards BWCC. Luke and James took BWCC's score to 81 for 2 when Luke was out for a very good 34 and James followed him shortly after for 28 - his first four deliveries being dispatched for 4's. There then followed a flurry of wickets but Jack MacIver used his county experience and held the innings together and hit the winning run to end up 6 not out. BWCC got home with over to spare but it was becoming very tense over the last few overs. All the BWCC team contributed to the win and was well deserved. <p>scores Winslow 95-9 BWCC 96-7 <p>Team:- Tom Sperring## Jeff Moxom## Luke Martin## James Miller## Lewis Ostacchini## Aaron Bailey## Jack MacIver## Alex Morgan## Michael Bryant## Chris Coldwell## Jonny Freeman,Chris,2010-03-08

112,The Waggoners overtook Wendover's score comfortably in the end but it could have been so much more difficult for Ballinger if Wendover had held their catches. This match was played on the artificial wicket at the Witchell ground## Wendover's main ground being out of action because of insurance problems relating to balls being hit onto the by-pass. Batting first## Wendover began steadily## with opener Morley picking up what runs were offered by tight bowling from Alex Macdonald and Ollie Richards. Once the Ballinger quicker bowlers were off they attempted to pick up the scoring rate and## although Charlie Wells kept control## Aaron Bailey and Sam Privett suffered from some heaves. Two went to hand to give Sam two wickets and James Stoddart and Thomas Maw finished the allotted overs tidily## James getting a bit of swing and a wicket. Alex and Ollie finished with one for ten off four overs and one for five off three respectively. Morley batted through the innings to finish on 42 not out## out of a total of 93. </><p>In reply Jeff Moxom and Charlie Wells opened with 20 from five overs before Jeff was out to a smart catch behind the wicket. In came skipper Richards## to be dropped first ball from a none too difficult chance## off a leading edge## at mid-off## and then survive a run-out chance taking a second on the mis-field. They were opportunities Wendover could not afford to miss but they were only the first as every Ballinger batsman survived a chance as the run rate accelerated; Charlie Wells making 16## Ollie a quickfire 18## Alex a brutal not out 31 and James Woods 8 not out. The innings closed as the evening got gloomy in the 14th over. Ballinger are through to the next round of the cup with much credit going to the younger players as only four 15 year olds were available. Lewis Ostacchini and James Miller performed athletically in the field and Aaron## Sam and both James all contributed with ball or behind the stumps.,Ian H,2010-03-08
137,<p>Ballinger notched their fifth win in a row on a glorious sunny evening at Stokenchurch.</p><p>Although this looks a comfortable win on paper in reality it was a different story. To many of the top order fancied their chances against the Stokenchurch bowlers but lack of concentration and application meant early wickets fell cheaply. Richard Wise made double figures then threw his wicket away with a rash shot while Callum Bright## Evan Webster and Jamie Wise batted sensibly to see out the 20 overs and to push the score past 80. The innings was rescued by Luke Martin. Carrying on his good form of late he showed the others how to mix solid defence with attack (4 fours## 1 six) finally being forced to retire having made 33. Fortunately Stokenchurch also gave us 22 runs in extras.</p><p>It was hoped that the Ballinger attack would be too strong for the opposition and so it proved with only 25 runs conceeded off the bat off 20 overs. However## a somtimes sloppy performance in the field cost 25 extras. Adam Robinson bowled well again conceeding just one run off his four overs. Six Stokenchurch batsmen were bowled## three by James Stoddart (Captain for today)## one by Sam Privett and Callum Bright making the most of his opportunity picked up two.

Sadly Downley's Peacock hadn't read the script and his 120 was one of the best innings seen at Ballinger. 202 looked a useful score but Riley and Branigan gave the Waggoners a solid start## then Mathews and Humphreys helped Riley edge closer to the finish line. Two lusty blows from Adams reduced the asking rate and finally a huge 6 by Riley## in the last over## finished the game in the Waggoners favour.</p><p>A perfectly timed innings of 108no by Riley was the toast of the day ( especialy by those belonging to the God Boycott faith) but once more everyone enjoyed an excellent game of cricket played in the right spirit.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08

With three of the team playing their first hard ball game and others playing their first match of the season the team were no match for a strong Chalfont team.</p><p>Bowling first Ballinger's bowlers did well in that they only concede 18 wides or no balls. Pick of the bowlers was Ed Cousins with 2 wickets and Michael Hinds who bowled two very tidy overs of leg spin. Harriet was her usual economical self## conceding only 1 run in her two overs. Max or Ben Dugdale (give me a clue how to tell them apart) did and excellent job behind the stumps and only 4 byes went past. </p><p>When batting the first 2 pairs## Chris Cooke## Max Dugdale## Charlie Rodwell & Ben Dugdale## were doing really well and had 33 on the board then disaster struck in the 8th over when 3 wickets were lost.

Even skipper Salisbury recognised the chance of some cheap wickets. Aldbury managed just 67 off the bat but chasing their 92 on this pitch always looked a difficult task. Their determination to win was shown in their use of just 3 bowlers.</p> <p>Ballinger's batsmen had to decide whether to go down all guns blazing before they got out to the dreaded shooter or just block.

Then disaster. Paul got one that pitched then shot straight along the ground.</p><p>Out marched Dom Birkby with 6 needed to win off 2 overs.

Ian Macivers figures were 8-5-8-6. This was high quality left arm spin. Humpreys did his job at the other end taking 4-29 and## for once## Ballinger's fielders had their catching hands on.

Batting first the Presidents side reached 204 with only Nick Adams 3-58 and Ian Davies 2-45 making any impression.</p> <p>President skipper Matt Riley used a missing jock strap as an excuse to drop down the order. He then sent his younger brother in to blunt Ballinger's opening attack## in particular Adams. Having made sure the bowlers were tired and the ball soft he made maximum use of an excellent batting track and rattled up a quick 92 (quick being a relative term).</p> <p>The Waggoner's then timed their run chase to perfection. Fallowfield - Smith led the way with an excellent 41. Making sure the Saturday skipper was watching in the hope it might get him moved up the order (buying copious quantities of beer tends to be more effective Fally). Then Jeremy Hunting's first appearance in a helmet at Ballinger obviously helped him as he added a watchful 49 and got Ballinger very close to their target## but with 9 wickets down and Pete Clifford on fire## it needed a skippers innings from Salisbury to guide them home in the last over.<p/><p>It was a great day and it was wonderful too see many people (especially children) watching.

One opener retired after reaching 30 and their number 3 continued the strong scoring. Harry Rix at first change took two wickets including opener Charlie Young and the run rate was held in check somewhat by some better bowling by Basty Richards and an inspired spell by James Rose who managed his first ever 5 wicket haul. Well done James!</p><p>Ballinger however did not help their cause in the field with sloppy ground fielding and lack of concentration with field positions. In all around 30 runs were probably given away needlessly and this can make the difference between winning and losing.</p><p>Chasing a challenging 127 we lost an early wicket when Freddie Gamble was run out after a mix up. Thereafter the boys batted sensibly and consolidated their position. Alex Humphrey again batted well and he had good support from Sam King## James Rose and George Kingston.</p> <p>Kingshill bowled well and fielded better and we eventually ran out of overs with our score on 89. So a loss by 28 runs to a team of mainly Year 8's## not a disaster but a match where more concentration on the basics of fielding and good length bowling could have seen a different result.</p>Stick at it boys and girls!Tim,Nigel,2010-03-08
223,<p>Beaconsfield won the toss and decided to bat. In spite of scoring 8 off the first 2 balls Ballinger soon started to put the screw on the opening pair with tight seam bowling. At the end of 4 overs Beaconsfield were 199 having lost 4 wickets. Some great bowling from Tom Edmonds and Matthew Dunnington. The bowling continued to be very tight backed up by some great ground fielding which resulted in a run out. With the combination of spin bowling and genuine pace Beaconsfield found it hard to accumulate runs. They ended on 266 having lost 9 wickets in the process.</p><p> Ballinger started their innings by losing a wicket on the first ball. This just served to get the openers to dig in and progressed to 204 losing another wicket in the process. Will Smith and Andy Rishton had a little trouble in their calling but also managed to add valuable runs taking the score to 217.</p><p> Tom McIntyre and Tom Butterworth came in and showed how runs can be easily accumulated by using the pace of the ball and playing simple cricket shots. They moved the score on to 233.</p> <p>At this point it seemed that if we carried on playing in the same vein we could win.</p><p>Max Maciver and Harry Bartlett did just this inspite of Beaconsfield continuing with their probing bowling and good fielding.</p><p> The last pair of Joe Hankinson and Matthew Dunnington took the responsibility of stearing the team to victory. 266 was passed in the 19th over and then they knew they just had to get 6 runs ahead in case there was a wicket.

155,Match Summary from last night:Although Chesham were not the strongest opposition they have faced the overall performance by everyone was excellent. I asked them to concentrate this time on not loosing wickets and building a score. Without exception everyone tried to do this and only 2 wickets were lost in the whole innings. Everyone batted well. The wicket was dreadfulEvan & Tom B - Good steady start## good running. Highlight## probably Tom E's lofted drive straight back over the bowlers headMax & Will. - Built on the start## continued to pick up the singles. Highlight - Will stepping slowly down the wicket to every ball in the last over which was OK because he didn't slog it & made sure he got something on it.Tom B & Tom Mc - Batted in a similar fashion to the other night . Nothing stupid## picked up the singles and hit the odd bad ball for 4 four. Highlight - Tom B taking a lifting ball on the helmet.Andrew & Guyan - Both reasonably calm ## good running with Guyan looking to give Andrew more of the strike. One wicket lost - run out. Never run if you cannot see the ball. Highlight - Shot of the day by Andrew## a clip off his legs through mid wicket.Mat & Joe. Much the same as the other night. Probably added about 30 even after loosing one wicket. Joe's was the innings of the day with some terrific off drives.The fielding & bowling was good throughout and wickets fell all the way through. One area of improvement - reduce the extras## especially wides. They also need to make sure that they don't loose their shape in the field as there is a tendency for everyone to slowly creep in.Finally and the most important point of all. The attitude of all the boys towards weaker opposition was fantastic. I received several comments about their conduct on & off the pitch. All were a credit to themselves & the club.,Roger,2010-03-08

Very few of the boys have had an opportunity to play on a real pitch so far## and a full-sized pitch too. </p><p>Ballinger opened the batting with Sam Privett and Stefan Otto## who braved a phenomenal opening spell from the fast High Wycombe bowlers. Luke Martin at 3## batted well## and scored 9 before being bowled. It looked as though we were going to be all out rather quickly## but then we had some solid performances by our mid-order to tail end batsmen## who recovered the situation quickly and impressively. Alex Morgan 8## James Stoddart 9## Richard Wise 11## Dominic Hutson 21## and Tom Sperring 7. This recovery spurred the boys on## and dented High Wycombe's confidence## denying them the last three wickets. </p><p>Dominic 21 not out## Richard Wise 11 caught## Luke Martin & James Stoddart 9 apiece## Alex Morgan 8## Tom Sperring 7 - (and a debate re the contentious runout followed over the next week!). Final Score 68 off the bat + 34 extras = 107 for 7 off 20</p> <p>High Wycombe came in to bat a little less confidently than might have otherwise been the case. James Stoddart opened the bowling with a serious maiden over## followed by really good spells from Luke Martin & Richard Wise as well kept the HW score down to 16 off 5; then 39 off 8 before things started to slip away from them. Despite some good bowling by the boys## and captain Stefan desperately trying to keep one particular batsman on strike## the High Wycombe batsmen 3 & 4 started to really put the runs on and denied the Ballinger bowlers the wickets they so desperately needed. High Wycombe finished on 84 off the bat + 20 extras = 103 for 1 off 16 overs. </p><p>I know the boys were disappointed - but I was pleased with their performance - we were simply outclassed on this occasion. At least they made HW work for hard for their victory. </p>,Ian,2010-03-08

However## despite Jack Thompson bowling Stefan for an unlucky 2## Ballinger upped their game and started to really put the runs on## taking advantage of some sloppy fielding## several wides## and a very fast outfield with a short boundary one side to achieve a magnificent 185 for 5 off 20. (A total of 23 fours & 3 sixes !!)Top scorers: Alex Morgan 37 not out (got to 36 before needed to retire## but with only 1 ball to go## the LH umpire insisted he stay put ….

158,<p>Ballinger batted first again## comfortable that even though they lost the toss## with the breadth of batsmen and bowlers within the squad## they no longer need to work out what score they're chasing## but leave that to the opposition to worry about! </p><p>Alex Morgan and George Bartlett opened the batting facing H&C's top bowler - who proceeded to despatch our first 3 batsmen a little quicker than anticipated## despatching top scalp Luke Martin for 0 . Kristian Otto (batting at 4) came in and proceeded to chalk up some sensible quick singles## a couple of fours and a six. He was as stunned as the H&C wicket-keeper himself to be caught behind after scoring 26 runs and snatching several byes & misfields. Dominic added a further 12 runs off the bat before also being caught behind with an unlucky top edge. The wicket-keeper's 2 minutes of stardom faded quickly as Jack Maciver and Richard Wise both met their targets of batting sensibly and retiring at 30 and 31 respectively - well done lads ! The sudden disappearance of batsmen 6 & 7 caused panic in the Ballinger dressing room as not one but two batsmen were suddenly needed within one run of each other## and someone wasn't ready at all ! Never mind Tom Sperring - you redeemed yourself in the field as usual with your steadfast fielding & excellent concentration. </p><p>Richard Wise 31 retired## Jack Maciver 30 retired## Kristian Otto 26 caught behind## Dominic Hutson 12 caught behind## George Bartlett 11 caught## <br>Final score: 113 off the bat + 32 extras (whoops!) = 145 for 6 off 20</p><p>Jack Maciver opened the bowling## finding excellent line and length## with only one run off the first over## a wicket maiden in his 2nd and only 1 run again off his 3rd over to complete a really good spell.

183,Widmer End 164-10 BWCC 162-10Adams onslaught fails at End<p>Ballinger missed the opportunity of moving into the top half of the table on Saturday when they contrived to lose a game they should have won easily. Widmer End won the toss and elected to bat first. They were soon in trouble at 19-3 with Lloyd in particular causing lots of problems. An excellent innings by Saead enabled Widmer to reach 164 but his dismissal by Davies started a rapid collapse. Davies finished with 5-38. Not a true reflection of how he bowled.</p> <p>Ballinger had 54 overs to score the runs but only Riley and Humphreys played with any conviction and at 121-9 the Waggoners were down and out. In strolled Adams and in 20 balls he completely changed the game. He scored 39 and with 5 overs left the game was in the bag. Unfortunately he tried one heave too many and lost his middle stump leaving the Waggoner 3 runs short of victory.</p> <p>Skipper Riley said that to get so close and not win was very frustrating but until we bat as a team we're not going to win these games.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
185,Monks Risborough 308 -3 BWCC 192-10<p>Ballinger would like to draw a veil over events at the Green on Saturday. </p><p>A combination of injuries## holidays and some football match left the Waggoners with a much weakened team. Monks Risborough took full advantage of this and## batting first## rattled up the first ever 300 score at Ballinger. The wicket was fast and true## the outfield like lightning## the temperature in the 90s and Ballingers bowlers were put to the sword. 308 came up in only 32 overs.</p><p> Ballinger's reply was brilliantly led by Adams who for some time had the Waggoners up with the required rate## but when he was out for 90 the rest of the batting subsided tamely and the Waggoners finished on 192. </p> <p> Injured skipper Matt Riley would like to thank Jack & Max Maciver and Andrew Rishton 12##10 & 11 years old respectively for turning out in place of some senior players and many of the older juniors. Ian Maciver got his wish of playing in the same side as his sons but I don't think he expected it to happen so soon</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
186,BWCC 220-9 Penn St. 141- 10<p>Another blistering hot day at Ballinger saw the Waggoners batsman take full advantage of the conditions. With skipper Salisbury leading the way with 57no##Webster (37) and Camp(39) making useful contributions on there season debuts## Ballinger were able to declare on 220.</p><p> Webster then removed Penn Streets openers## Lloyd produced a good spell of 3-24 and Fallowfield-Smith cleaned up the tale with 3-11. Not a bad effort whilst wearing his pads and gloves. A good all-round fielding display by Ballinger reduced Penn Street to 141 -10</p>The Salisbury machine rumbles on.,Nigel,2010-03-08
150,<p>Ballinger Under 15s Against Ley Hill Under 15s on 16 June 2006</p><p>Ballinger Under 15s produced another excellent performance in beating Ley Hill. Ley Hill batted first but struggled early on against a superb display of pace bowling from Tom Crick who had match figures of 3 wickets for 7 runs off his 4 overs. He was well supported by his fellow bowlers## in particular Fergus Hardy 1 wicket for 5 runs off his 4 overs## Charlie wells 2 wickets for 10 runs off 4 overs and Jason Stone 1 wicket for 5 runs off 2 overs. Ley Hill were dismissed for 75 runs off 19 overs. </p><p>Ballinger made an excellent start in reply with a fine opening partnership of 29 runs from Richard Clarke and Charlie Wells.## The team were brought home by Ollie Richards with 28 not out and James Wood 13 not out. </p><p>A thoroughly professional performance from Ballinger Under 15s. </p>,Ian,2010-03-08
160,The Nick Rose - Ollie Richards combination swept away the top of Winslow's batting order to set up a comfortable win that confirmed Waggoner's place at the top of Conference 3 and earn them a place in the league semi-finals. Batting first after winning the toss Winslow opened with Bishop and the dangerous Callum Price. Tom Crick and Alex Macdonald opened the bowling for Ballinger and made good use of a quick## bouncy pitch but without taking a wicket as they completed their allotted overs. <e><p> With the bowling changes came the wickets however. First Fergus Hardy tempted Price into a lofted drive but “did” him in the flight. Tom Maw judging the catch nicely at mid-on and making it look easier than it was. But it was Ollie Richards charging in from the White Hut End who found the pitch most to his liking. Getting plenty of bounce he had the Winslow batsmen constantly in difficulty on the back-foot and induced four chances behind the wicket where they were gobbled up by Nick Rose. Nick## who has not kept regularly this season## turned in an immaculate performance## not just in taking the chances but in his glove work generally. Ollie finished with 5 wickets for 8 runs from his overs before Charlie Wells and Jason Stone polished off the tail. Charlie taking 2 for 6## aided by a stunning one-handed catch by Jason at slip## and Jason 1 for 1 off one over. The last wicket was a smart run-out by Alex Macdonald who removed the brave H. Bishop## youngest of the Bishop brothers## who had been pressed into service after a late drop-out and offered some late resistance## pulling Wells for a boundary. Winslow finished on 70 all out## probably a few more than they should have got after Ballinger placed some over attacking fields and conceded a few too many extras. <e><p> Ballinger started steadily but Richard Clarke was bowled off an inside edge to bring Ollie Richards in to join Charlie Wells. They progressed steadily until the beginning of the 9th over when Ollie cut lose against the leg-spin of the felicitously named Turns## smashing 18 off 5 balls## before offering a hard caught-and-bowled which was taken. Tom Crick then came in and he didn't hang about either hitting a rapid 9 before Charlie caught the mood and pulled a six to finish the match on the last ball of the tenth over## unbeaten on 21; 34 having come off the last two overs as Waggoners came home on 71 for 2. <e>Ballinger now go into a semi-final against Stokenchurch away.,Ian H,2010-03-08
154,Ballinger won comfortably on a beautiful evening at the picturesque ground on the common but this was only possible because of 6 players from younger age groups who allowed the fixture to go ahead.<e>Batting first Ballinger openers Richard Clarke and Nick Rose opened fairly steadily but## seeking to push the score along## Nick holed out for 13. Ollie Richards## arriving straight from a school game to fill his customary slot at first wicket down## came to the wicket in good form but## hit on the pad sweeping## was adjudged leg before wicket. Ballinger were now in some trouble because## at number 4 while other batsman were en route## was Fergus Hardy## yet to bat this season## a fair striker of the ball but not a batsman guaranteed to occupy the crease. He started with a couple of customary swipes before nailing a powerful straight drive for 4. This seemed to give him confidence and he started to score quickly## some powerfully hit pulls mixed with some genuinely classy drives off the back foot. Meanwhile Richard Clarke was batting confidently## running unselfishly and keeping the score moving and together they took the score past the hundred mark both completing their fifties; Richard for the third time this season and Fergus for his first ever half-century. Jeff Moxom## Jason Stone and the classy James Wood## who had been delayed## added a last flurry of runs to post a total of 150 for 5.,Ian H,2010-03-08
189,<p>A combination of a blistering onslaught by Nick Adams and another brilliant spell of left arm spin by Ian Maciver were just too much for Ley Hill on Saturday.<p/><p>Ballinger won the toss and## for once## decided to bat first. Good opening spells by Ottaway & Peterson had made Ballinger work hard for their runs and a couple of wickets from Helm tightened the screw. The appearance of Adams changed everything. He made his intentions clear when hitting his first ball for six and the mayhem continued in the same vein with him reaching his 50 off 18 balls. This enabled Ballinger to reach 221## which looked a good total on dusty pitch.</p><p>When the Hill batted they were in trouble right from the start when they lost Lown to the 4th ball of their innings. This was the first of Ian Maciver's 5 victims and skipper Riley's decision to open the bowling with him was vindicated with Maciver finishing on 12-9-16-5. With the other bowlers all doing their bit## and the fielders taking the catches## in particular “buckets Riley”## the Hill were hustled out for just 76.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
190,TPCC 151- 10 BWCC 152- 5<p>Ballinger visited Tring Park on Sunday and on another scorching day had to field first. All the bowlers put in good spells with the pick being Dom Birkby with 4-21. Tom Crick bowled really quickly and on another day will get a better reward than the 1 wicket he took. Tring were bowled out for 151.</p><p>In reply Hardy & Riley got the Waggoners off to a steady start but a stand of 90 between Hunting and Riley set the seal on the game. When they were out in quick succession it was left to Jason Stone to guide Ballinger home<p/>,Nigel,2010-03-08
191,<p> For the second time we lose the opportunity to beat a side below us in the league. It doesn't happen when we play Holmer Green</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
195,<p>When Downley gave Ballinger first go on what looked to be a difficult wicket## the visitors were a little concerned. Fortunately for the Waggoners Riley and Humphreys were in imperious form. Their opening partnership of 80 gave the innings substance## which## with the help of a well paced innings by Kerry was enough to get the Waggoners to 183- 9.</p><p>Downley were then treated to a master class in spin bowling. Fergus Hardy took 6-42 in 12 overs of high quality off spin. His line and length were immaculate and none of the Downley batsmen were comfortable against him. Aided by some excellent catching## including 1 brilliant effort by Ballinger's new keeper Davies## Ballinger's bowlers hustled Downley out for 133. This gave Ballinger a much needed 25 points.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
197,H&C 275-5 BWCC 195-5<p>Ballinger played host to a Sri Lanka B side on Saturday and the difference in class showed. There was a lot at stake on this game and Sri Lanka made the strange choice of batting first. Their openers put on a 100 with Gunasekara scoring an immaculate 85 and the strangely named Pritchet 57. The loss of Gunasekara to an excellent catch by keeper Fallowfield- Smith didn't slow Sri Lanka's progress as his replacement Daluwata scored 29 at more than a run a ball. In the meantime## Pritchett had been removed by Davies## and Sri Lanka's Rifai had been quietly scoring an excellent 64. Sri Lanka declared on 275-5 off 39 overs.</p><p>When the Waggoners batted Sri Lanka opened up with their 2 spinners Daluwatta & Dias and had immediate success when skipper Riley was bowled first ball of the innings.Branigan also went early but Sri Lanka's spinners## nor their change bowlers Rifai and Gunasekara## were able to remove McIntrye. He batted resolutely for his 98no and was helped by Davies (39) and Kerry to secure the draw. Ballinger ended on 195-5. This was the first completed game that Sri Lanka B have failed to win this year and their decision to bat first may cost them the title.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
198,BWCC 180-6 30 overs The Lee 106-9 30 overs<p>Ballinger played the Lee on Sunday. The weather was pretty awful and this efected the way the match was played. Having started a normal time match a long interruption forced the skippers to decide to change it to a 30 over game. Ballinger were batting at the time and a rapid change in tactics was required. First Fallowfield-Smith(24) and then Davies (54no) went on the charge but it was the 76 added by Davies and Macdonald that enabled the Waggoners to set The Lee the difficult target of 180.</p><p>Crick and Macdonald make a formidable opening attack and they soon removed the openers with just 19 on the board. Then a fine spell of 3-5 in 4 overs by Stone ripped the heart out of the Lee innings. Guy Morgan did his best for the visitors with 21 and his son Alex## a Ballinger junior## was 13no at the end.</p><p>Sadly it was obvious from the 15th over when the Lee needed 130 at nearly 9 an over that the game was over and there was nothing left to play for. As it happens the Waggoners were unable to take the last wicket and the Lee ended on 106-9. An honourable draw in a time game - a stuffing in an overs match</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
192,BWCC 232 - 8 Long Marston 122-10<p>On a beautiful day Long Marston is lovely place to play cricket. The ground nestles in site of Ivinghoe Beacon in the vale of Aylesbury.</p><p>Skipper Jamie Kellock took full advantage of winning the toss and his batsmen didn't let him down. Openers Humphreys & Hunting gave the side a good start and then Kellock and Davies put Long Marston's bowlers to the sword. Kellock went past 50 for the 3rd time this season his innings ending on 74 when he missed another swipe to cow corner. Davies was even more ruthless scoring 36 of his 45 in boundaries.</p><p>Unfortunately no record was kept of partnerships so there is no way of knowing if Kellock and Davies set one.</p><p>The Waggoners bowlers were far to good for Long Marston and with Hardy to the fore they soon bowled LM out for 122. Fergus took 6-11 in 11 overs of high quality off spin.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
193,BWCC 130-10 v Knotty Green 131-9 29th July<p>Ballinger were inserted by Knotty Green on Saturday. The Waggoners were reasonably happy with this as the pitch looked like it would deteriorate and with a team full of spinners they were always going to be in with a chance.</p><p>Riley and Humphreys got Ballinger off to a steady start with 39 off 15 overs. Then there was a dramatic collapse with Davies## Fallowfield-smith and Adams out in 6 balls. Adams was obviously suffering from oxygen deficiency at the rarified hights of 4 in the order. Maciver(16) and Crick(31) added some sanity to the situation with stands of 31& 37 with Riley & Kerry. Kerry was slightly disgruntled to find himself below both Adams and Fally and to add insult he was then fingered by Maunsell - His first time.At 120- 8 Hardy recognised the importance of the situation and swiped his first ball straight in the air.</p> <p>130 -10 was always going to be difficult to defend but Ballinger set about the job with great determination. Another excellent spell from Maciver kept the Green batsmen under pressure and then a fantastic 12 over stint from Adams (5-18) reduced Green to 117 -8 in 38th over. Sadly the 39th produced 14 lucky runs and the game had slipped away.</p><p>Ballinger have to learn how to win these games if they want to compete at the top end of the league rather than trying to stave off relegation.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
194,BWCC 222 - 8 v Weekenders 144-1030th JulyA second wicket stand of 104 was the corner stone of Ballingers big total. With Richards(73) making a rare visit and Kellock(50) on a roll The Waggoners soon reached 222-8.Once more Hardy's spin was the key to bowling the Weekenders out His 3-27 and 2 each for Birkby & Humphreys was too much for the opposition and they were all out for 144 in 35 overs.,Nigel,2010-03-08
199,<p. This may be one of Ballinger' more fortuitous abandonments as playing Holmer Green with with a side full of kids didn't bode well. 8pts was probably a good result.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
201,Widmer 119-10 BWCC 120 - 4<p>Ballinger played Widmer End on Saturday and registered a useful win. Widmer elected to bat first and were soon in trouble when Lloyd bowled their opener in the second over. Unfortunately for the Waggoners this only brought Ali Hashmi to the crease earlier than they would have liked. Hashmi proceeded to smash 90 out of 105 in just 21 overs. It was fantastic to watch unless you were a Ballinger bowler. He was finally out to a brilliant catch by Maciver. Sadly for Widmer## Nick Adams was back to his best and was running through the rest of the Widmer batsmen. He finished with 6-29 and The End were all out for 119.</p><p> The side recognised that they were missing skipper Riley as this was an ideal situation for him## 63 overs to score 120. As it was Ballingers batsmen made hard work of scoring the runs with only Fallowfield-Smith(33no) looking comfortable. Davies survived a VERY close LBW decision to help Fally add 40 for the 5th wicket. Hashmi & Collins bowled well for Widmer but 119 was always going to be difficult to defend and the Waggoners earned their 25points in the 27th over </p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
202,BWCC 194-10 Lt. Gadd 109 - 10<p>Ballinger had another good win on Sunday when they beat Little Gaddesden . Batting first the Waggoners reached 194 thanks mainly to an excellent knock of 75 from Andy Branigan. Second highest scorer was extras with 45.</p> <p> An excellent opening spell from Michael Senior(3-24) soon had the Gadd in trouble and with Hardy( 3-11) bowling another top spell they were never in the hunt. 12 year old Jack Maciver finished them off with 3 wickets for 2 runs in 2 overs- all clean bowled. Little Gaddesden finished on 109.</p> <p> It's worth mentioning that only 3 players in the team were over 30 and boy did they look old</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
224,On a beautiful evening at Stokenchurch the 15s played their best cricket of the year to comprehensively defeat a strong Stokenchurch side. Batting first the Waggoners openers of Richard Clarke and James Wood started brightly but both were soon caught behind by Lovegrove off of Duffy - Ballinger 17 for 2 off four overs. This brought together Ollie Richards and Alex Macdonald: when they were parted## eleven overs later## the score stood at 117## the Stokenchurch bowlers having been dispatched to all parts of the irregular-shaped boundary. Ollie departed having scored 58## including eight fours and one six## in a display of power and technique. After Ollie departed## Alex increased the tempo of his scoring so that 56 were scored in the last five overs## Alex finishing on 80 not out## Tom Crick and Tom Maw batting with great maturity to ensure he had most of the strike. BWCC 174 - 4 in 20 overs. <e><p> As well as Ballinger had batted## their bowling display was even better. Alex Macdonald## showing no signs of tiredness## and Tom Crick## working up good pace## opened the bowling and## at the end of their spells## Stokenchurch were 31 - 5 (all bowled) off 7 overs and the contest was over. Richards## Hardy and Stone kept the pressure on the middle order and James Stoddart## with two wickets## and Freddie Cooke## with one## finished the innings off. 76 all out from 16 overs and a Ballinger win by 99 runs. A storming performance by Ballinger and one that should give them much confidence for the final.,Ian H,2010-03-08
225,Ballinger Waggoners under-15s have retained their Bucks County League title## defeating North Crawley by 31 runs in the final played at Ballinger.<e><p>On a cold day## with overcast conditions and a green pitch## Ballinger won the toss and## sticking to plan A## elected to bat first. After 7 overs of tight opening bowling by Crawley## with Ballinger restricted to 11 for 1## it looked as though skipper Ollie Richards had made the wrong decision. However the solution was in his own hands as he strode to the wicket at number 3. Refusing to panic## he played himself in before putting the innings back on course.<e> <p>Beginning with some trademark drives## Ollie added 37 with Richard Clarke before being joined by Alex Macdonald who## typically## went on the offensive from his first ball. The pair added 79 before Alex was out for a 22-ball 32 attempting to add to his six boundaries. Ollie Richards was now totally dominant and## when he was well caught on the long-on boundary by Monty Stoyles off the first ball of the last over## he had scored 80 off 54 balls## an outstandingly mature innings. Fergus Hardy with a towering six and James Wood## slashing a four through square cover added another valuable 12 runs before Ballinger's innings closed at 138 - 5 off 20 overs; 47 coming off the last 4.<e><p>Ballinger's opening bowlers Tom Crick and Alex Macdonald now made use of the favourable bowling conditions in Crawley's innings and broke through in the fourth over when county batsman Alex Walker drove Alex Macdonald powerfully## but in the air## to Ollie Richards who held on to the chance. The key to the match was how the Crawley batsmen handled the Ballinger spin bowlers and## when they were introduced at 30 - 1 from 8 overs## the match was in the balance. Spin duo Fergus Hardy and Charlie Wells have gained plenty of experience in these situations however and## backed up by athletic fielding and tidy wicket-keeping from Nick Rose## maintained the pressure exerted by the opening bowlers. The powerful Simon Myatt was smartly run out by Tom Crick attempting a quick single and now Crawley were in trouble at 37-2## their two most dangerous batsmen back in the pavilion## off 10 overs.<e> <p>Ballinger resisted Crawley's attempts to match the run-rate## with another brilliant run-out by James Stoddart## and brave efforts in the deep by Tom Maw and Jason Stone## injured catching Crawley captain Matt Hodges on the boundary off Fergus Hardy and replaced by Jeff Moxom## exemplifying the teamwork. Ollie Richards bowled top-scoring Matt Goss for 37 and## despite a few late boundaries## Crawley finished on 107 -5 off their 20 overs## 31 runs behind.<e><p>So Ballinger retained the title they won last year## perhaps a more noteworthy achievement in that the playing squad was not as large this year and contributions were made throughout the season by younger players## including James Wood## James Stoddart and Jeff Moxom## who all featured in the final but also players from the under 14## under 13## under 12 and under 11 teams who enabled us to field a full team in some of the difficult matches early in the season. The squad will be rewarded by the prize of a trip to Lords for a specialist coaching session and a tour of the world famous ground.,Ian H,2010-03-08
203,BWCC 87 v Monks Risborough 91-8<p>Saturday had a real end of season feel to it and Ballinger played like the season had already finished. Having convinced themselves that the pitch was going to play badly Ballinger's batsmen were none to pleased when their skipper lost the toss again and the Waggoners had to bat first. They then contrived to get out in as many bizarre ways as possible with only Alex Macdonald(27) and Davies (40) showing any idea. The Waggoners were all out for 87.</p><p>Monks Risborough looked in no trouble until Hardy## tripping over his own feet## contrived to run out one their openers with a brilliant throw. The Waggoners were then frustrated by some wild slogging by Monk's early order but wickets kept falling and Adams was on fire again. Another 3 wickets from him dragged Ballinger into the game and suddenly they had a chance. Kerry took a steepling catch off Hardy to remove Monks dangerous Hussein and then Davies brilliant stumped Rafiq off Hardy but with 8 down one more wild slog clinched for the home side.</p><p>Ballinger's cause may have been helped if they'd had a full team. Having only 9 batsmen didn't help one bit</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
204,BWCC v WendoverSunday 3rd SeptemberBWCC 164-10 Wendover 99-10<p>Ballinger played hosts to Wendover on Sunday and put their youth policy to the test by playing 8 juniors with ages ranging from 10 - 17years.</p><p>The Waggoners batted first and were soon in trouble when Humphreys failed again and with Kellock and Branigan unable to make much impact it was left to the middle order to set a decent total. Led by Alex Macdonald((27) who had good stands with Moxom((19) and Ian Maciver(20)## then 12 years old Jack Maciver weighed in with an excellent 22no. Eventually Ballinger were all out for 164.</p><p> Michael Senior then led Ballinger's bowling attack and his 2-6 off 9 overs showed the tight line he now bowls. Alex Macdonald removed Wendover's opener but it was another fantastic spell of spin bowling from Fergus Hardy that destroyed Wendover. His 5-18 off 8 overs was his fifth 5 wicket haul of the season.</p><p>Ballinger used 8 bowlers and Wendover were unable to force the pace against any of them finally ending their innings on 99</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
196,Amersham Hill 136-10 v BWCC 137- 4Sunday 6th August<p>Ballinger had a comfortable win against Amersham Hill on Sunday. When Hill batted first## skipper Kellock was able to give all 8 of his bowlers a go. Once again Hardy was to the fore with 3-19 closely followed by Lloyd(3-9) and Birkby(2-12). Thus Hill were bowled out for 136. For Ballinger Tivey(64no) and Webster(67) put on 133 for the 3rd wicket which ended the game as a contest but Webster's dismissal did enable Tom McNeil to secure his second first ball dismissal of the weekend.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08

249,Missenden Misfits 109 for 10 (28 overs)Ballinger Wagonners 107 for 10 (33 overs).Again BWCC are let down by their batting after a good performance in the field. After early pressure from the opening bowlers## Humphries(3wkts) and McNeil(1wkt)## wickets begin to fall. The openers were ably supported by Hutson(1wkt)## Stone(1wkt) and Stoddart(3wkts). Misfits captain produced a well controlled half century. After an early tea wickets began to tumble## Hunting(can't pull## shouldn't try) skyed one off the top edge## Kellock was beaten by an in-swinger which cut away just enough to beat the outside edge and take the top of off stump. There can be no excuses for Paul(I'm not talking to you) Humphries who was out pulling at shoulder height to a short delivery that bounced twice before rolling onto off stump. Tom Maw played very well for 25 but the highlight of the batting was a fine final wicket stand between Hutson and Stoddart who brought us to within 2 runs of victory.,Jamie,2010-03-08

282,One of those matches where## as umpire## you are tired out from trudging from square leg to put the bails back on. Oddly a close game where the boys felt they had such an easy target to reach that their heads were not foccussed on the job in hand and some felt slogging was all that was reqd. A lesson learnt I hope. Elliot Brooks guarded his wicket perfectly under pressure from their best bowlers in the last few overs. Due to scoring abberations had he lost a wicket the match could have been lost. Fielding positioning still needs improvement (often too close and wrongly positioned). Best bowling: Fennell 2 for 3## Thomas 6 for 2## Bentley 8 for 2 and Howe 11 for 2. Best batting: Fennell 14 for 1## King 11 for 1. Someone achieved 2 for 3## which was very exiting if he was bowling## unfortunately he was batting!!!,Dick,2010-03-08

283,A tough match against 3 county bowlers. Having peaked at the dizzy height of 218 for 4## after 14 overs a collapse ensued. Best bowling Thomas 9 for 2## Bentley 2 for 1 and Brooks 7 for 1. Batting best: Cuthbert 5 for 0. Nevertheless a good match taht all enjoyed apart from Brooks and Martin who were the wrong end of Cheshams Freddie Owens hatrick.,Dick,2010-03-08
280,A very good start to the season with some sharp fielding and good defending of the wicket## only 1 wicket lost to a the thinnest of edges for a wicketkeeper catch. Best bowling came from Max Bailey (5 for 2) and Eddie Bentley (5 for 1). Best batting: John Martin (16)##Eddie Bentley (14)and Alex Howe (11),Dick,2010-03-08
284,A tight match in a beautiful setting with what looked a perfect track## but which turned out to be very spongy## such that the ball consistently stayed very low## making batting difficult (straight bat is the answer). Monty Cuthbert captained the team very well managing the field placing and anticipating well with good bowling selection to get the best out of the surface (spinners bowling in to the less bouncy end). Toby King also kept wicket very well. Best batting was John Martin 11f0##King 6f0##Brooks 4f0.In bowling Will Reid (9f1) and Alex Howe (11f2)are to be congratulated for switching to spin (which matched the pitch## relatively new to both of them## but success in practice was emulated on the pitch today). Alex narrowly missed his hatrick. Lots of good bowling## in particular: Matthew Fennell (11f3## all wickets in one over)and Eddie Bentley 3f2## including a maiden in the 3 overs). Brandon Plumb achieved 6f1 and Monty 7f1. Claudio Bassano was agressive as always in his bowling and batting##including a wicket maiden. Fielding was generally good with 2 runouts and 3 catches## including an excellent difficult midfield catch by Eddie Bentley.Well done by all## in particular John Martin who not only top scored but guarded his wicket very well.,Dick,2010-03-08

251,Longwick 161 for 10 (32.5 overs) Ballinger 165 for 6 (36.2 overs)On a hot Sunday afternoon Ballinger travelled to Longwick with the youngest team it has put out all season. Apart from three adults the Juniors ranged from 17 - 11.Ballinger won the toss and decided to field first in a 40 over game. All of the 7 bowlers used took wickets## with 2 each for Humphreys## Hutson and Stone and one apiece for McNeil## Martin## Kellock (yes we were that short on bowling!!) and Hankinson.Longwick were eventually dismissed for 161 in the 32 over.In reply Ballinger lost Clarke early on for a duck## but Mason (31) and Kellock (32) put on 70 for the second wicket before Mason was caught and Kellock was controversially given out stumped. This bought the 11 year old Will Smith to the crease who batted with maturity beyond his years. Wickets began to drop in clusters with the score not getting going## and it was left to Tom McNeil and Luke Martin to provide the entertainment for the day## by smashing the bowling to all parts of longwick.Victory was achieved in the 36 over with Tom not out on 26 and Luke not out on 35 including three big sixes.The game was enjoyed by all## and played in the right spirit throughout. Congratulations must go to all the juniors who performed exceptionally and are a credit to the junior section.Man of the Match - Luke Martin for his 35no. Combined good defence with attacking instinct and produced the shots of the day when he cover drove the opening bowler for two fours in a row.,Jamie,2010-03-08
334,<p>Chesham B won the toss and elected to bat first. They started very quickly with former Ballinger Waggoner Alex Morgan hitting 46 runs. Then our bowlers found their length and line and they restricted Chesham to 104-5. Tom Sperring took 3 wickets thanks to a great catch by Jack Hankinson and 2 in the deep by James Miller. Nigel's fielding session the previous evening proving fruitful.</p><p>When BWCC started we lost a couple of quick wickets but kept up with the run rate. A good partnership between Luke Martin and Jeff Moxom saw us reach 55-3 after 10 overs. Sadly## once Luke was out for 40## with 2 sixes and 6 fours## the innings lost momentum. All the remaining batsman contributed runs but no-one was able to stay around long enough to see us home. The team were un-done by Chesham's spinners and could not cope with their accuracy and length.</p><p>Again extras were a contributory factor## we conceeded 22 (13 wides) against their 8. We must improve this area of the game. This was a much better performance than the last match - well done to all.</P><p><b>Batting:</b> Martin 40## Miller 9</P><p><b>Bowling:</b> Sperring 3-13## Hankinson 1-12## Bailey 1-12</P>,Chris,2010-03-08

Ballinger made the most of the good weather in their fixture against the Albury Entertainers on Sunday posting a competitive total of 211 for 6. It was Richard Clarke who (aged only 16) stole the show for Ballinger batting unbeaten the whole way through the innings scoring a elegant 99## leaving him just one run short of his maiden century.Ballinger's youth were no less competent in the field with James Stoddart (aged 14)## Luke Martin (aged 14)## Tom McNeil (17) all claiming wickets. But it was Rhodri Webster## still only 19 himself## who polished off Aldbury taking 4 wickets and 4 catches as there were bowled out for 100.,Jamie,2010-03-08
285,A good win## top scorers Brandon Plumb (11f0)## Eddie Bentley (9f0)Alex Howe scored 15 for 1 wicket. Max Bailey led the bowling with 5f1 off 3 overs with Tom Ryland's 1st appearance with 5f0. Will Reid achieved 7 for 1 and Mike Thomas bowled 2 tidy overs of spin (3f0). The fielding was satisfactory although controling a team and ensuring fielders are in the right position is not as easy as it seems as our rotating captains are finding out...,Dick,2010-03-08

He guessed correctly as the slow pitch made runs hard to come by. First Adams and Lloyd bowled with their usual miserly economy and took 2 wickets each## then spinners Hardy and Davies finished the job off with Hardy recording the excellent figures of 4-16.</p> <p>The Waggoners set off in pursuit of Downleys 115 with a certain amount caution with Riley batting 40 overs for his 49. Adams gave the innings some impetus with 21 off 8 balls then Lloyd and Maciver saw the visitors home - but only just - as the players walked off the field the heavens opened.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
253,BWCC v Scuttlers Scuttlers 221-7 BWCC 120-9<p>On Sunday Ballinger played host to a very strong ScuttlersX1. Following an excellent lunch the Waggoners were forced to chase leather for the next 2 hours as the Scuttlers rattled up 211.</p> <p>Ballinger openers Webster and Hughes did a great job in putting on 67 for the 1st wicket but after Will Hunting removed them both in successive overs and then Waggoner's danger man Hunting 2 overs later the writing was on the wall.</p><p> The introduction of the Scuttler spin king Kerry saw the wheels fall off completely as a combination of his guile and some stunning fielding reduced the Waggoners to 9 down## but skipper Salisbury## and last man Tom Graham## managed to hang on for an honourable draw. </p> A very pleasant day,Nigel,2010-03-08
341,An evening that started sunny got rapidly gloomy as a poor batting display by Ballinger amassed a total of only 71. Fortunately it was also getting literally gloomy and the rain when it came was torrential ending any hopes of a result and ensuring the points were shared.,Ian H,2010-03-08
335,<p>Ballinger won the toss and elected to bat first. Openers Joe Hankinson and Dom Hutson had to face 2 of 3 County bowlers in the Amersham side and they saw off 6 overs from the opening bowlers. However runs were hard to come by and Joe was bowled for 6 by the first change bowler. A partnership between Dom and Joe Stevens of 25 upped the scoring rate until Joe and Dom were out in quick succession. This brought together James Miller and Jeff Moxom who then batted out the remaining 8 overs## putting on 47 un-beaten runs. The Amersham bowlers all kept good line and length and made Ballinger work hard for their runs. Whilst 95-3 looked a reasonable score we felt that another 15-20 runs would have made it more difficult for Amersham.</p><p>When Amersham started their innings## Joe Hankinson and James Stoddart opened the bowling and kept the run rate under control and each took a wicket to remove both openers after 6 overs. Aaron Bailey and Tom Sperring then came on to bowl and Tom got a wicket in his first over. However Amersham started to up their scoring rate even though Tom Sperring took two more wickets and ended his spell with excellent figures of 4-1-3-14## the second match running Tom has taken 3 wickets in a innings. Unfortunately the our bowlers could not exert the required control on runs from both ends and some loose bowling allowed Amersham to reach their target in the 16th over for the loss of 5 wickets.</p><p>This was a competetant display against a team containing 3 County players. The team fielded well and took all the catches offered. The boys should feel proud of their performance against goo opposition.</P><p><b>Batting:</b> Miller 26 no## Moxom 16 no## Hutson 19## Stevens 12</P><p><b>Bowling:</b> Sperring 3-14## Joe Hankinson 1-7## Stoddart 1-18</P>,Chris,2010-03-08
235,Haddenham 100-10 BWCC 101-6<p>Ballinger managed to sneak in another win in amongst Saturday's thunder storms. Playing bottom of the table Haddenham meant this was a must win game for the Waggoners.</p> <p>Skipper Riley did his job by winning the toss and inserting the visitors. A brilliant catch by McIntyre should have set the standard for the Ballinger fielders - sadly not. Fortunately the Haddenham batsmen gave them plenty of practice. Davies took 5-20 in an a spell that Mr Bassett would have recognised## a brilliant run out by Hardy and the return of Adams saw the end of The Haddenham's innings for 100.</p><p>The Waggoners were reduced to 30-4 by some interesting umpiring. A stand of 60 between Kerry & Birby(21no) steadied the ark and Ballinger eased home with 15 overs to spare </p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
288,Beaten## by a vocal## determined and very good bowling side. Ignoring wickets we scored 70 runs## they scored 65. Its nice to dream. Our bowling was also tight which restricted their run flow. Fielding too from both sides was generally sharp,Dick,2010-03-08

Fergus Hardy and Dom Birkby added another 30 precious runs at the end so Ballinger reached the relative safety of 165-10.</p><p>The Monks went about the task of chasing Ballinger's total in their normal flamboyant style but Birkby was on top form with ball and his spell of 3-23 kept the visitors under control. A brilliant reflex catch by Whelan had removed danger man Shah and with Hardy( 4-46) weaving his magic The Monks were bowled out for 115.

413,Hughenden Valley 48 - 10 BWCC 49-4<p>After a couple of miserable weeks Ballinger got their MBL campaign back on track on Saturday.</p> <p>Top of the table Hughenden made the strange decision to bat first on what was always likely to be a difficult wicket. In Nick Adams (4-12) and Phil Lloyd( 3-20) the Waggoners have the ideal bowlers to exploit any oddities in a wicket and by the time they had finished their spells Hughenden were 30 - 7.

355,Ballinger Under 15s gave agood account of themselves against a strong Bovingdon team narrowly losing in the penultimate over. Ballinger batted first and made a steady 96 for 7 off 20 overs. The highlight of the batting was the impressive batting of Jack Maciver 29 and Max Maciver 20. Their excellent batting was well supported by the running and intelligent batting by James Rose who scored 11 and George Kingston who scored 8.Bovingdon in reply batted excellently and scored 98 for the loss of 3 wickets.Ballinger## however## bowled well and the pick of the bowlers who maintained a good line and length were Sebastian Richards with 2 wickets for 9 runs off 4 overs## Harry Rix 1 wicket for 18 off 3 overs## J.Rose 0 for 18 off 3 overs and an excellent opening spell from Jack Maciver 0 for 10 runs off 3 overs and Jack Hankinson 0 for 10 runs off 4 overs.,Derek,2010-03-08
364,Ballinger Under 15s## starting with 10 players and reduced to 9 following an injury to Mathew Rose## were beaten by a strong batting performance by Wendover which Ballinger were unable to match.Wendover batted first and scored 129 for 4 wickets on a fast batting track. Ballinger bowlers did well to stick to their task## in particular George Bailey with 1 wicket for 15 runs off 4 overs. The other bowlers Jack Hankinson## Sebastian Richards## Dominic Hutson## James Rose and George Kingston stuck manfully to their task and did well to keep the score at just over 6 an over.Ballinger## in reply## never really settled and finished on 72 for 7.

432,<p>Widmer 104 -10. BWCC 105 - 6</p> <p>On a very slow wicket at Widmer End it soon became clear that flashing blades weren't going to be the order of the day. What was required was a bit of grinding and in Derek Richards and Will Smith Ballinger had the perfect opening parntnership.</p> <p>Chasing 104 was likely to be a problem but an excellent opening stand of 45 between Derek(35) and Will(16) broke the back of the job.Acceleration was provided by Tom Sperring(16) and Matt Rose(12)and when things looked like getting tight a huge 6 from Paul Rose and couple of good shots from Ben Carlin saw The Waggoners home</p> <p>Earlier Ballingers bowlers had kept Widmer on a really tight rein with Sperring (5.3.6.0) and Carlin ( 10 3 19 3) leading the way. They were ably supported by James and Matt Rose and once again Bastie Richards bowled his 12 for just 3 an over## taking 2 wickets in the process.However the star of the show was Rob Rose taking 4-8 in 5 overs of quality off-spin. The fielding was excellent with Sperring leading the way and another tidy display from Paul Barnigan behind the stumps</p>,,2010-03-08
433,<p>Widmer End 198 - 7 BWCC 177 - 8</p> <p>The 2's managed a very creditable winning draw and an important 15 points in a match against Haddenham where all 3 results were still possible late on in the game.</p> <p>Bowling first Ballinger took 4 wickets in the first hour thanks to a tight spell from Peter Petrie## Andy Thompson and a wicket in his first over from Basty Richards. Haddenham then dug in and their 5th wicket partnership proved vital as stand in skipper Rix's bowling changes failed to click.</p> <p>With Basty tying down one end a return from Thompson did the trick with a wicket and a slowing of the scoring rate. The remaining Haddenham opener was unmovable and carried his bat for a hard worked 95 not out## Haddenham finishing on 194-8.</p> <p>Ballinger lost the early wicket of Michael Bryant (2 bounces or more?) but Petrie and Richard O'Kelley moved the score on well. Paul Branigan batted sensibly after O'Kelley was dismissed with Petrie playing the senior role.</p> <p>After Branigan was out Paul Rose kept Petrie company and any result was still on however with Rose's dismissal and the loss of 3 quick wickets meant that only a winning draw was really possible.</p> <p>This was achieved emphatically with Petrie scoring at will and never looking in trouble. A mighty 88 not out was well deserved by Peter - well done!Everyone was happy with the result and 15 points and everyone got involved in the game which was a plus point.</p> <p>7 games in it's 4 wins## 2 draws and only one loss so far - bring on Prestwood on Saturday!</p>,,2010-03-08

392,BWCC 58 -9 Chenies 58-10How Ballinger managed to win this game is beyond comprehension.</P> <p>From 6-5 after 2 overs they managed to drag themselves to the riches of 58 - 9 thanks to the efforts of Rory Seekins and Monty Thompson</p> <p> This never looked like being enough when Chenies were 24 after 8 overs but some more magic from Seekins and some unbeleviable batting from Chenies meant that they needed 1 run with 2 wickets left and managed to lose them both. Therefore Ballinger won by losing less wickets</p> Amazing,Nigel,2010-03-08
434,<p>Prestwood 58-10 BWCC 60 - 0</p> <p>Skipper Kerry won a very important toss on Saturday. With rain around it was a must that## bottom of the table## Prestwood batted first</p> <p>Having done his part it was then up to the Waggoners bowlers to do theirs and they duly obliged</p> <p>Harry Rix was the first to strike curtesy of a difficult catch made to look easy by Derek Richards. Then father Tim got in on the act with Kerry taking the chance at slip.Then it was a father son act with Tim taking an excellent catch at slip to help Harry finish with 2-20 off his 5 overs.</p> <p>The introduction of 'Fingers' Richards normally causes the opposition batters a problem and once he'd settled into his ryhthm Saturday was no exception. 3-15 off 9 overs was reward for another excellent spell</p> <p>With Petrie causing chaos at the other end (4-2-4-3)Prestwood were soon bundled out for 59 in only 26 overs</p> <p>Derek Richards and Adam Riley opened up for Ballinger and on what was now a very slow wicket worked their way to the 60 runs required for victory. It took 20 overs but neither looked in an trouble</p> <p>Victory was achieved 20 minutes before the heavens opened and it's doubtful if any further play would have been possible. Hence the importance of the toss</p>,,2010-03-08

401,Ballinger batted first and everyone contributed to post a solid score of 289. Hamish (top score of 9) and Ollie C openned and took every opportunity with excellent running between the wickets. Will Gibbs played the two shots of the day. Matthew and Ollie N-M posted the leading partnership of 24.As usual## it was the performance in the field which really impressed. The first ball (Freddie) of the innings was caught sharply by George. 17 wickets taken in all. Two fine catches by Elliot and a very relieved looking Oliver N-M held his chance. Tight accurate bowling from Ollie N-M## Will G## Hamish## Theo## and Elliot. Our glove man. Stephen had his work cut out and took a sharp catch to an excellent ball from the Captain Elliot.

435,Ley Hill 265-8 BWCC 245- 6<p> Ballinger's skipper Nigel Kerry## was somewhat taken by surprise when on winning the toss Ley Hill elected to bat first in this top of the table clash.</P><p> On an excellent track He was soon shown why as The Hill were soon rattling along at over 6 an over.</p><p> Ben Carlin and Tom Sperring both bowled well again with Ben being rewarded with 3 wickets But Tom had one of those days when nothing went to hand or the ball beat the bat.The introduction of Seb Richards immediately brought reward with a wicket first ball. Unfortunately Bastie struggled with the wind and was hit out of the attack by Hill's Phillips.</P><p>Meanwhile Andy Thompson was putting in a top spell with 3-51 off his 12 overs. He removed danger man Phillps and then was helped by a brilliant catch by Sperring and another top delivery to remove the Hill's middle order</P>.Hill's skipper Bell## meanwhile## was moving serenly on to an excellent 79 no. A couple of late wickets including one from new man Nick Howe gave the Waggoners another bowling point</P> Ley Hill finished on 265.<p> Balinger were surprised that the visitors had batted their full quota of overs but by setting the Waggoners the tough task of reaching 236 for the winning draw it made sense. </P>. <p>Unfortunately the Hill hadn't allowed for Richard O'Kelly who batted brilliantly on what was still an excellent track. Not wanting to take too many singles Richard put the fast out field to good use by scoring 20 fours## throw in a couple of 6s and you soon get to the 107 he scored.</p> <p> Without any of the regular openers available skipper Kerry was press-ganged into opening.After a few scratchy moments early on## especially against the excellent Asquith## Kerry soon settled down to help O'Kelly move the score along. By the 30th over the pair had reduced the asking rate to 7 an over## which was easily achievable on this pitch. Unfortunately Richard perished going for one more big hit and with the fielders all on the boundary it was now going to be difficult to win the game. Kerry kept going but with 5 overs to go he to went for the wrong shot and was caught on the boundary for an excellent 97. This left 40 to score off the last 5 over for the win but only 10 for the winnin draw. Sounds easy but 3 quick wickets put the Hill back in the game. A nerveless Alex Howe then led the Waggoners to 236 they needed for the winning draw and managed to hang on with Tom Sperring to frustrate the visitors.</P><p>Another really enjoyable match played in an excellent spirit,Nigel,2010-03-08
399,Ballinger Under 15s completed a comfortable win against a competitive Amersham Hill side.Ballinger## captained by Sebastian Richards## won the toss and scored 106 off their 20 overs. The highlight of the batting were the performances of Chris Cooper with 19 and Mathew Rose with 22. Chris Cooper showed that he is developing into a fine attacking batsman. The performance of Mathew Rose particularly caught the eye with a stylish 22 before being unluckily run out. Mathew is clearly going to develop into a fine number 4 batsman.Amersham Hill in reply reached 83 for the loss of 9 wickets.The opening attack of Jack Hankinson and Tom Sperring was too strong for the opposition who were reduced to 7 runs for 5 wickets. Jack Hankinson's bowling figures of 5 wickets for 6 runs off 4 overs again showed that he is fast becoming a top bowler at this level## well supported by Tom Sperring who returned 1 wicket off 3 overs## bowling into the sun.Tidy performances from the remaining bowlers## Sebastian Richards## George Bailey## Harry Rix## George Kingston and Luke Hughes ensured a comfortable win.Finally well done to Jack Bull who kept particularly well looking into the sun. Jack is a fine prospect for the future and already looks comfortable keeping wicket at this level.,Derek,2010-03-08
403,BWCC 379 - 3 Chenies 237 - 10For the first time we were able to field a full strength side but## unfortunately## it was against pretty weak opposition. Chenies were no match for the strength of the Dugdales and the style of Xavier and 400 looked on the cards at 1 stage. The same applied when Chenies batted with accurate bowling from Xavier and the rest of the team keeping them down to 237.</p>Chenies did their best but with the majority of their team only 10 it was always going to be a tough task for them.</p><p>Sadly this was the last league game of the season and although we finished 2nd in the league I don't feel that we didn't reach our full potential.</P> <p> Hopefully the boys will take advantage of summer coaching and the winter programme that is now being put together</P>,Nigel,2010-03-08
406,Ballinger batted first. Everyone batted sensibly against some good bowling. Only 5 wickets lost## two of which were silly run-outs## Poor calling and bat running-in being the culprits. Monty and George top-scored on 8 - both playing good looking shots. Hamish kept his average up## contributing 7. The final score was 258.In the field## the team showed the usual resilience and commitment in adversity. There was consistently good fielding and backing up although catching opportunities were not taken. Good inexpensive bowling from Ollie NM## Matt OK## Ollie C## who have all tightened up their line and length - well coached## Roger. George's very economical 2 overs for 2 runs and a wicket was not quite good enough to earn him man of the match## which went to Will G for an outstanding 3 for 7. I also awarded Monty a batting Man of Match for his fine come-back (from injury) top score.Although the gap was quite large## really the difference between the sides was one player who tonked some reasonable bowling around the ground## including a 6. Saif## who captains the U10 County team## scored 38 with some crafty harvesting of the strike - this took the game away from Ballinger.Overall## a mixed season with some good wins and a few losses but a pleasure to manage a highly spirited and commited U11B team## whom I am sure will form a great U11A team next Summer.,Simon,2010-03-08
436,Cadmore 147 - 10 BWCC 137 - 10Skipper Kerry won the toss again and was happy to insert the opposition on a pitch that was difficult to tell from the outfield.</p><p> Cadmore End is a difficult place to bowl especially when the strip is at the very top of the square. Anything short normally ends up in the cemetary and Saturday was no exception. It took openers Tim Rix and Andy Thompson 4 overs to find their range by which time Cadmore had scored 50</p> <p> Once they'd settled down things moved back in the Waggoners favour. With Rix taking 3 - 37 and Peter Petrie ( 4-16) amongst the wickets again it looked as though the visitors were going to remove the End for about 100. An annoying 7th wicket stand of 40 took the home sides score to 141 then Ballinger let 2 youngsters add anothe 6 runs. How important would these be in what was likely to be a tight game</p><p> Along side the senior bowlers Rob Rose had bowled a tidy spell of off-spin and Jake Cutter a couple of excellent overs of leg-spin.</P> <p> Only 32 overs were used to bowl the home side out so Ballinger set off in pursuit of their target with quiet determination.</p><p. Will Smith (26)## Peter Petrie and Andy Thompson added 49 for the 1st 2 wickets. Then Jack Bull batted well for his 26 but the rest of the middle order collapsed. When Jack was out Ballinger still needed 55 to win but still had 19 overs to score them in. Could the tail end manage it.</P><p> Skipper Kerry did his best aided by first Jake Cutter with a stand of 19 then with Evan Webster with a stand of 20 but when Kerry fell with the score on 130## with still 10 overs to go## his frustration was obvious.</p><p> Rob Rose and Evan added another 7 when a suicidal run ended the Waggoners innings on 137.</P><p> The 6 runs given to Cadmore last pair## too many byes and 8 dropped catches all contrived to make Ballingers task harder. Add a dodgy LBW and an unlikely catch to remove 2 top batters and you have some excuses for this loss</P><p> Positives were Jack Bull's and Evan Webster's batting and Rob Rose and Jake Cutters bowling</P>,Nigel,2010-03-08
382,Ballinger Under 15s lost off the last ball in an exciting match against Ley Hill.Ley Hill batting first were restricted by some fine bowling to a score of 85 all out off 20 overs.All the bowlers contributed which was particularly pleasing## namely Jack Maciver with 1 for 17 off 3 overs## Jack Hankinson 2 for 13 off 4 overs##Sebastian Richards 2 for 10 off 4 overs## Tom Sperring 1 for 12 off 4 overs## George Kingston 2 for 16 off 3 overs and Harry Rix with 1 for 8 off 2 overs.In reply Ballinger made 82 runs for the loss of 8 wickets. The highlight of the batting was the fine innings of 33 runs from Will Smith. Unfortunately none of the remaining batsmen made double figures. A flurry from Jack Hankinson and George Kingston at the end which yielded 13 runs from the last over almost saw us home but in the end we were undone by the failure to capitalise on Will's fine innings.,Derek,2010-03-08
388,An understrength Ballinger Under 15s lost an exciting match in the last over against Hawridge and Cholesbury.Ballinger batting first made 107 runs for the loss of 3 wickets. The highlights of the batting was the partnership of 95 runs between Will Smith who scored his maiden 50 for the club abd Jack Hankinson who was dismissed for 37. Will Smith## in particular has developed into a fine opening batsman and is particularly strong off his back foot.Jack Hankinson## in turn## has matured into a fine batsman at this level and has the ability to develop into a fine stroke player.Hawridge and Cholesbury in return made 109 for the loss of 7 wickets## principally due to an opening partnership of 62. Once this partnership had been broken Ballinger tore into the remaining batsmen taking 6 wickets for the next 37 runs.The pick of the bowlers were Max Maciver with an excellent spinning display which yielded 5 wickets for 13 runs off his 4 overs. Tom Sperring bowled extremely well taking 1 wicket for 6 runs off 4 overs.The failure to break the opening partnership was however to prove fatal and in the end Ballinger were just unable to pull off what would have been a great comeback in the circumstances.,Derek,2010-03-08

439,Potten End 235-5 BWCC 175-6On another belter of a wicket at Ballinger the Waggoners bowlers lacked the control to keep the Potten End batsman in check.<p/><p> With ball swinging around in the humid atmosphere Ballinger's youngsters found it difficult to find the right line. It wasn't until Peter Petrie was introduced into the attack did skipper Kerry finally get some control.Peter's 5 over spell 2-9 followed by an excellent spell of 7-0-32-0 from Jake Cutter meant one end was being tied down. Unfortunately runs were coming at 7+ an over at the over end.</p><p>Jack Hankinson's second spell was much better than his first with just 14 runs coming off this 5 overs<p/><p> Potten suprisingly batted there full 45 overs when an early decleration might have given them more chance to bowl out theyoung Balinger side<p/><p> Peter Petrie also starred with the bat scoring an excellent 61. He was well supported first by Jack Hankinson(21) and then by the injured Ben Carlin (22).<p/><p> Ben had damaged his knee whilst fielding which meant he was only able to bowl 5 overs and had to bat with a runner. He was also run out in slightly odd circumstances. He was at the strikers end and having played a shot the non-striker called his runner through for a single. The fielder launched the ball at the 'keeper and Ben had to take evasive action. The keeper removed the bails in his attempt to run out the non- striker but recognised that he was probably in and was somewhat surprised to find the batsman had been given out. Unfortunately in getting ot of the way Ben had moved out of the crease and was given out.</p><p> Peter was out shortly after this with score on 120.It was then left to James Stoddart(20*) and skipper Kerry to guide the home side to maximum batting points.

438,The Lee 212 - 8 BWCC 215 - 7<p>After the disappointments of the narrow loss against Cadmore End and a rained-off match against Waddesdon it was important to get back in to winning ways against The Lee.</P><p>The game was played at Missenden's Misfits ground i Little Missenden## a great outfield but a slow pudding-like pitch which meant that anything short sat up and begged to be hit.Winning the toss and fielding first (no surprise there) Ballinger started well thanks to a tight length and line from Andy Thompson and James Stoddart. Two quick wickets## one thanks to a great catch behind by Paul Branigan## and some slow scoring gave encouragement but a determined 3rd wicket partnership helped The Lee steady their ship and they started to score more quickly.</p><p>Bowling changes did not really do the trick but a great catch by James Rose at mid off got us back into things and a T. Rix caught and bowled helped. However## it seemed that every poor ball was punished and The Lee's number 4 rode his luck and accelerated## scoring a good 91 supported by various partners## so much so that 110 came off the last 15 overs as The Lee reached a competitive 212-8 off their 45 overs.</p><p>A steady reply was what was required and despite losing opener James Stoddart early on Derek Richards & Paul Rose batted sensibly to add 70 for the 2nd wicket. Paul was hampered by another muscle pull (when will he learn to warm up?) necessitating a runner but the good news was that the run rate picked up with James as runner! Derek was out for a well crafted and elegant 38 thereafter Rose and Paul Branigan kept up the good work. When Rose was out for an excellent 47 the run rate was down to just under 6 an over. Tom B departed despite looking good and another 80 was needed off 14 overs. Branigan senior hit well before being caught behind for a timely 44. After which Tim Rix and James Rose nurdled a few and ran as fast as possible keeping the run rate manageable.</P>When James was caught at point young Ian Stoddart came to the crease but was treated cruelly by Rix who demanded quick singles and quick 3's when young Ian would have rather dealt in 4's## so much so that Ian became the 2nd batter with a pulled calf!</P><p> A winning draw was passed and when the 38th over yielded a vital 15 runs we were almost there. A casual flick for 4 from Thompson confirmed the win with 5 balls to spare## Rix the older not out on 37.</P>Overall a very good result - and after the collective batting failure of the Dad's at Cadmore End the threat of further disciplinary action from Skipper Kerry could be lifted. However the win was tighter than it needed to be due to too many long hops and another batch of shelled catches. We don't half make life hard for ourselves - but a win is a win and it was a good game of cricket.</P>,Nigel,2010-03-08
423,I wonder if the weather Gods are on our side. A match against the top side and another against our least favoured opponents rained off on consecutive w/es. <p>Come on chaps you can do it</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
424,<p> Hooray - A dry day at last## even though the pitch was very damp and the outfield in front of the pavilion positively swampy. Inserted by Haddenham## our batsmen made slow progress against tight bowling - unsurprising## given the conditions. With commendable application## Paul Humphreys(27)## Richard O'Kelly(unluckily run out for an impressive 20 on his 1st Team debut)## and Fally with a very solid 35##kept the scoreboard ticking over## but with the overs running out Ian Davies ( 24) forced the pace## while wickets fell at the other end. A final total of 145-8 didn't look too great## but the wicket was drying out... </p><p> Ian Davies## skippering## decided not to waste a new ball## and entrusted the old one to his spinners## Ian Maciver and Fergus Hardy. An inspired decision## as it turned out## with the Haddenham batsmen all at sea from the very start. Sharing the wickets## as Haddenham tumbled to a miserable 53 all out## Ian took 5-34## and a severely hung over Fergus amazed us (and himself ?)with5-14. </p><p> A really good team performance## and an enjoyable game played in the right spirit. Brilliant !!! </p><p> Ian and the team would like to thank the ground staff for making sure the match was playable</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
442,The 2s had to cool their heels again this w/e when Haddenham had to scratch. 25 points is good news but skipper Kerry needs to bowl a few more overs to ensure he stays at the top of the bowling averages.,Nigel,2010-03-08
443,For the second week running the 2s had to miss a game because the opposition couldn't raise a team. That's 4 weeks on the trot without a match.</p> <p>Not sure where that will leave us re promotion but it might mean we're in with a shout.</p> <p>Our last game is against top of the table Ley Hill who were playing Cadmore End this w/e.At the moment the Hill are 21 points ahead of us and if they beat Cadmore we can all relax. If by some strange event they lost then next weeks game could be important. Lets hope the weather doesn't interfere</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
444,BWCC 76 -9 Ley Hill 79 -2<p>The excitement of getting so close to promotion was too much for the 2s on Saturday.<p/>The numbers were simple## we had to get 25 points and stop the Hill getting 8.The opposition very kindly put us into bat so now it was up to us. We knew the wcket was going to be interesting and with a very slow outfield it was difficult to decide what a winning total would be. Unfortunatley trying to decide was as far as we got. With only Kerry and Thompson getting into double figures Ballingers total of 76 was never going to be enough.Paul Rose being take off to hospital with 2 broken bones in his hand didn't help matters## but the Waggoners had no answer to Thompsons leg-spin and were bowled out in just the 31st over.<p/><p> Ley Hill's batters took a much more positive approach than Ballinger's had and were soon punishing any lose deliveries. Andy Thompson bowled his usual economic spell and was rewarded with 1 of the 2 wickets to fall. Kerry took the other as a C&B. <p/>.<p> The Hill were home and dry in just the 21st over and were desereved winners of this match and the league title<p/><p> It's been a really enjoyable first season and I would like to thank all those who took part. In particular Jon Bryant who has managed to umpire most of the matches. It makes a huge difference to have someone in the white coat each week.<p/> <p>Now we must go away and start plotting next seasons campaign<p/>,Nigel,2010-03-08
426,BWCC 251 -3 Knotty Green 139-10At last Ballinger managed to put together a top batting and bowling performance on the same day</p><p> Put into bat by 2nd place Knotty Green the Waggoners batters knew they had to perform to avoid the spectre of relegation. With his season spoilt by injury skipper Riley was please to help Rollo McIntyre put on 35 for the 2nd wicket but with Riley's departure the real fun began. Joined by Ian Davies the 3rd wicket pair put on 194 in only 27 overs. With McIntyre 106no and Davies out for 98 Ballinger finished on 251-3<p/><p> Now that the Ballinger bowlers had a decent total to work with could they take advantage? The Green batters were moving serenely toward their target until the introduction of Fergus Hardy. Hardy proceeded to produce a master class in off-spin bowling. By the time he had finished his spell (12.4.41.5) he had removed the Greens top 4 batsmen and with Phil Lloyd (9.2.24.1) providing a tight grip at the other end## reduced The Green to 118-6. Jack Maciver continued his fine run in 1s with another 2 wickets## Davies grabbed 1 wicket and Hardy finished a perfect day by running out The Green's last man which left the visitors on 139<p/><p> An excellent alround performance to finish the league season on and the curry afterwards tasted that much better<p/>,Nigel,2010-03-08
467,"""<p> A glorious sunny day - and the Iconoclasts arrived with only 8 players!

552,A brave young Ballinger team took on the experienced Amersham U11's last night in a League and Cup double-header. Amersham batted first and knocked up a creditable 170-3 with the help of 57 extras! Highlights of our fielding were a great catch by Freddie Sanders from Archie's bowling. Finn Hynes bowled out one of their openers for 1 run## with Max Firth also getting a wicket. Our lads batted out the full 20 overs but were kept to a low score by a tight Amersham field. Lots of work to do. Better luck next time lads!,Nigel,2010-03-08
472,<p> Having won the toss## Waddesdon elected to bat## perhaps unwisely## but not all of their players had turned up on time. (A lesson to be learned ?) Against a tight opening attack of Tom Graham and Nick Adams their progress was painfully slow## and the pressure was maintained when Rollo McIntyre and Ian Maciver took over. Wickets fell steadily## and Waddesdon only reached a total of 87 in 39 overs. Had butterfingers Ballinger not dropped half a dozen catches## their innings would have been even shorter. Best figures went to Nick (4-23) and Ian (4-25)##but Rollo's 1-13 in 9 overs was remarkable## in that he seldom gets a bowl! </p><p> Facing a less than daunting task## Ballinger quickly lost Jamie Kellock## but thereafter Paul Humphreys (40*) and Rollo (42*) cruised to victory in a mere 24 overs.</p><p> Maximum points for the second week running## but doubtless much tougher times lie ahead.... </p>,Nigel,2010-03-08

473,<p>Sunny & warm## good-looking track## win toss = bat first. Which is exactly what skipper Ian Maciver did. Unfortunately the in-form Paul Humphreys was run out just as he was getting going## but in came the equally in-form Rollo to join Jamie K## and proceeded to blitz the Widmer End attack as he raced to a superb ton.

568,Ballinger 244 - 5Chesham 235 - 7Ballinger just pipped Chesham in a really exciting game last night.Ballinger batted first and the opening pair of Jack Peck and Max Firth did a good job until the last 2 balls of the innings when both were out. The next 2 pairs (Jamie Fulcher and Jamie Kingston## Harry Livingstone and Taylor Levitt) moved Ballinger back to over 200. Then Rob Farquhar and Angus DS batted and ran between the wickets really well to put on 20 in their 4 overs. The final pair of skipper Tom Petrie and will Arnold added gloss to the innings with a classy 17.Ballinger then bowled and fielded very well including a couple of good catches. But Chesham kept going and with 3 overs to go they had sneaked 10 runs in front. On came the skipper to ake a vial hat-trick. Another tight over from Max Firth meant Chesham needed 10 off the last over. A 4 of Will Arnolds first ball## followed by a single meant they were within a boundary of Ballinger's score then Will produced a'jaffa' to put the game beyound Chesham's reach.

493,<p>Finally## we play one of our older fixtures in glorious weather after 4 years of being rained off! What a game it was## too! A wonderful advertisement for timed games## rather than limited overs. At the start of the last over any one of three results was possible.</p> <p> Bourne End won the toss and elected to bat## scoring 216-4. They were assisted early on by some dropped catches and ordinary BWCC bowling. However## Ian Maciver (1-10 off 5 overs)## with assistance form Jack Hankinson (2-45) and Jack Maciver applied some brakes## and B/End declared their innings after 36 overs##leaving BWCC with what turned out to be 41 overs to reach this target. </p><p> James Wood(16) Phillip Doyle(17)and Jeremy Hunting(27) had good starts## and at 70-1 BWCC looked in good shape. Two wickets in two overs slowed the run rate temporarily.</p><p> Enter Fergus Hardy and Will Smith. A stand of 62 was the key partnership of the innings## with Will giving Fergus most of the strike. Fergus made his highest score (and first 50) in senior cricket(56)## hitting cleanly and very responsibly. However## both were out in quick succession. 14 overs left and 6 runs an over needed.</p><p> Enter Jack Maciver(29) - again- batting sensibly and not panicking despite losing two more partners and bringing the total needed down to 24 off 4 overs before he was dismissed. Eight wickets down! This dismissal brought Sebastian Richards in to join Ian Maciver.18 runs needed off 3 ## then 15 off 2 overs.

474,<p> For the second week running BWCC won the toss on a perfect sunny day## and decided to bat on what looked a good Ley Hill wicket. Skipper Matt Riley## back from injury## and Paul Humphreys gave us a bright enough start## putting on 29 for the first wicket in 7 overs. Then the rot set in. Against tight bowling and fielding## our batsmen were tied down## and wickets fell with monotonous regularity. Dogged knocks by Andy Thompson (28 off 65 balls) and Jack Maciver(26)kept the scoreboard ticking## but the last 5 wickets went down for only 28 runs## to leave us with a measly total of 126## and gifting Ley Hill 6 extra overs. </p><p> In reply## both Ley Hill openers were dismissed with only 22 on the board - an excellent start for BWCC - but then the catches started to go down - yet again! - and Ley Hill were cruising towards victory with 66 on the board off only 15 overs. At which point the dangerous and experienced Rennard was clean bowled by an exuberant Phil Lloyd. This seemed to induce panic among the following batsmen## and with top-scorer Peterson superbly caught by Ian Maciver 4 runs later## the remaining Ley Hill wickets tumbled in the space of 7 overs## to leave BWCC## amazingly## winners by 22 runs. Star bowlers were Andy Thompson with 4-20## and Phil Lloyd 4-32. Nick Tegg took 3 catches behind the stumps in only his 2nd gamefor the Firsts## and there were smart catches by Matt## and Charlie Wells.

491,<p>Ballinger arrived at the largest ground around## at Taplow## on a sunny day with the youngest team put out for a long time. Things got tougher before the first ball was bowled## when our keeper/opening bat failed to turn up. Not a good start!</p><p> Skipper Salisbury won the toss## and asked Taplow to bat first on one of the best tracks around. When both openers were removed with only 19 on the board## thanks to Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson## the three Ballinger seniors wondered if it was going to be our day. Oh how wrong they were.The next batsmen added 219 runs before normal service was resumed## and wickets started to fall. Taplow eventually finished their innings on 262-8## the wickets being shared between Adams## Jack Hankinson## Richards## Humphreys## Cutter and Matt Rose.</p><p> Ballinger's openers Humphreys and Joe Hankinson started the reply## and put on 99 before Joe was bowled by Taplow's first team captain and opening bowler for 8 in an hour and 15 mins.Joe batted beyond his years##and was a valuable ally to Humphreys who was sending the ball to all parts of the ground. Wickets fell at regular intervals## and Humphreys went on to score 133 before he was bowled attempting a pull shot to a ball that rolled along the ground. The remaining batsmen hung around for more than 15 overs## before Richards received an unplayable delivery## giving victory to Taplow by 90 runs with only 9 balls of the game left.</p><p> All the juniors performed exceptionally## and are a credit to the Club's Junior Section. They stuck to a hard task in the field## and played the game in excellent fashion.</p>,,2010-03-08

514,Braddenham 175 - 7 42 OversBWCC 164-9 43 Overs<p> It was a beautiful afternoon at Ballinger but skiper Kerry was concerned about his 11th man. When he won the toss## which appears almost inevitable these days## was he to field first whilst 1 man short or take the corinthian attitude and bat first on what looked like an excellent track? Could he trust his young bowling attack to stand up and be counted?</P><p>As usual he took the negative approach and elected to field</p><p>Opening with Tom Sperring and Evan Webster the young Waggoners attack soon got into their stride and with Webster swinging the new ball prodigious amounts and Sperring bowling a tight line they kept the Braddenham batsmen in check</p>Alex Howe and Matt Rose continued the job then Rob Rose settled into a 10 over spell where he took 2-47. Bastie Richards was his usual economic self with 1-15 off 7 and Jake Cutter finished the job by taking the wicket of the visitors danger man.</P><p>Ballinger's fielding and bowling was excellent all afternoon and forced Braddenham to declare at 175 - 7</P><p>Last minute substitute## Derek Richards opened the batting with Peter Petrie and they both looked in good 'nick' sadly Peter was undone by an inswinger and Matt Rose followed next ball to a 'jaffa'. Paul Rose## with his new bat## helped Derek add over 40 for the 4th wicket. Then Derek's 1st innings of the season ended with an inglorious swipe but in the mean time he had given the team an excellent platform with his 49 (jug avoidance). Tom Sperring fell to a good catch and Evan Webster## after looking in no trouble## also fell to a wild swipe.The skipper and Bastie then added 50 for the 8th wicket bringing the Waggoners within 13 runs of victory## but with 5 balls left Nigel became a member of the swipers club and left 4 balls for the last 2 batsmen to survive.<p/><p> At this point parental (Sara) and sibling ( Matt) influence came into play and instead of listening to the instructions from his skipper Rob Rose decided that family ties were more important so ' going for it' was the order of the day. Consequently he became the 2nd member of the Rose family to be out 1st ball.</p><p>Fortunately his dismissal meant that Bastie ended on strike and was able to see out the last 3 balls</p> <p>The average age of the bowling attack was 14 and the skipper was able and happy to let the boys do their job. All the boys need to do now is recognise that batting against adults isn't that hard then we can all rest easy. </p><p>We should have won but it was an excellent game enjoyed by all.</p> <p>Finally## as the skipper tries to learn how to walk again## a plea.

511,<p>An unknown opposition## a large ground and a good looking track greeted us at Aylesbury on Saturday and after a win the week before we were keen to add more points.</P><p>Batting first a mix up resulted in debutant Ian Hardy being run out## a real shame. Jack Bull got a start but was then out for 11 leaving us at 12-2 and needing consolidation. A good partnership then developed between Petrie and Rix (Snr)## watchfully to start with but then scoring more quickly to the point that after 31 overs we have reached 130. Rix (54) departed and thereafter## instead of building a competitive total## we capitulated in fairly spectacular fashion## all out for 148 in 40.1 overs##</p><p> Petrie making a fine 51 but a total that was looked very much on the light side.</P.<p>Quick wickets were required and with openers Tom Sperring and Harry Rix bowling well they both obliged with a wicket apiece and at 15-2 there was every chance that we could force our way back into the match.</p><p> Sadly a combination of some hard## adventurous hitting## a pitch that seemed to get better as the afternoon wore on and too many bad balls meant that our total was overhauled quickly with Aylesbury winning by 7 wickets.</p>T<p>he positives were some decent fielding and a competitive opening attack but these positives did not make up for some poor stroke decisions and at least 2 bad balls an over. </p><p>With that in mind we must learn to be more ruthless## more consistent and a little more positive with our batting.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
510,<p>After a successful first season in the league we wanted to start this term with a win against Prestwood to maintain our development. We fielded a very young (and old) side## with 9 under 16's and no one between the ages of 17-46!</P><p>Losing the toss and being inserted was not what we would have chosen and at 10-2 after 10 overs it was clear that someone was going to have to play an anchor innings. Step forward Peter Petrie! Peter batted for the majority of our innings## giving no chances and crafting a well judged 72. It was the backbone of our total as it grew to a very respectable 196-9.</p><p>Importantly we also batted our full 45 overs with every batsman contributing around Peter. First Rix (snr) hit a quick 47 before needlessly holing out at long on## then James Rose hit some powerful blows (before needlessly holing out….). Enter Bastie - promoted up the order and boy did he take his chance## hitting a very assured 30 in the partnership that took our total from slightly wobbly to very acceptable.</p><p>Time for tea - thanks Veronica! And to plan our attack on the Prestwood batters</P>.Spoilt for choice with up to 10 bowlers to pick from stand in skipper Rix opted for Ben Carlin and Jack Hankinson to open. After two overs and at 2-2 it was the dream start## a wicket apiece## one thanks to a great catch at square leg by Robert Rose it couldn't get much better could it? In fact it did## with Hankinson taking 3 wickets with some great controlled bowling - late in duckers that the Prestwood batsman just couldn't handle.</p><p> Carlin picked up another and it was time for a change. Evan Webster and Bastie took over and we didn't have to wait long for results. Evan was in-swinging the ball a good 4 inches a time which combined with a good length meant that he was a real handful. At the other end Bastie soon settled into a repetitive groove tempting the Prestwood lower order and giving little away.</p><p> Wickets fell quickly and after 20 overs the match was won## Prestwood limited to 61 all out and a very impressive winning margin of 135 runs for the 2's.</p>Special mention must go to Jack Hankinson (3-15) for getting us off to a great start## Evan Webster - also 3-15 for keeping the first change very tight and to Bastie (2-11) and Ben Carlin (2-20). Important mentions too to Robert Rose for two excellent catches and to Jack Bull who kept wicket well despite a swinging ball and little carry.</p>The recent rule changes also helped.

556,Dylan Shellard led his team to a very close defeat at the common last night. After a tight bowling display keeping Wendover down to 119 runs## with Dylan taking 2 wickets## Waggoners looked favourites to win## until a late collapse saw them end up 32 runs short.

516,<p>The Waggoners 2ndX1 returned to winning ways on Saturday with a comfortable win over Haddenham</p> <p>Hadenham won the toss and decided to make first use of what was likely to be a slow pitch - it had been under water on Tuesday. Unfortunately they came up against 1st team super star Phil LLoyd making a forced appearance for the 2s.He immediately removed one opener and bowled an intial 6 over spell of 2-9</p> <p>. This was very fortunate for skipper Richards because at the other end first Tom Sperring ( 1-27) and then Ben Carlin(2-37) decided to test the middle of the pitch. This was much to the liking of the visiting batsmen and reguar excursions were made into the carpark and neighbouring gardens. Fortunately they both sorted themselves out and bowled decent spells.Evan Webster( 1-19) started as the others but adjusted his length quickly.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The two spinners Rob Rose (2-42)and Sebastian Richards (1 -28) struggled with their line and length on the slow pitch before Lloyd returned to finish the Haddenham innings on 168.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Skipper Richards opened Ballingers innings with Will Smith and##following a sumptious drive and an easy single from Will## Derek decided to leave his first ball - fatally. Kim Hughes went in the next over which brought in-form Peter Petrie to the wicket. After a couple of exploritory swishes Peter set about the Haddenham bowling with relish. In 18 overs he and Will added 109 of which Peter scored an excellent 51.Will(82*)continued on serenely and with help from Paul Brannigan and Ben Carlin guided the Waggoners home to a comfortable win in only the 29th over.</p> <p>This was a very mature knock from Will and bodes well for his future</p> <p>It was a beautiful afternoon at Ballinger## an enjoyable game played in an excellent spirit## a fantastic tea provided by Heidi and a couple of pints to finish with. What more could we ask for.</p>,,2010-03-08
476,<p> A perfect sunny day greeted BWCC on their first ever visit to Ibstone's attractive ground. The wicket looked to be a good one## but when Ibstone won the toss and bowled first## Ballinger's batsmen were definitely uncomfortable. A combination of low bounce and accurate bowing meant a run-rate of barely one per over after 14 overs## and both our openers gone.Paul Humphreys and Ian Davies steadied the ship## but with the score on 44 Paul was unluckily bowled## then Rollo went first ball - LBW## one of several apparently harsh decisions. Jack Maciver too perished LBW## and at 61-5 in the 25th over## things were looking distinctly unpromising. However## Ian Davies## back after a 5 week break (in the middle of the season## Ian ? ) was growing in confidence## and with solid support from Jamie Kellock took the score to 143 before Jamie was bowled. Enter Ian Maciver ! Apparently having been inspired by 20/20 heroics elsewhere## he proceeded to smash the Ibstone spinners to all parts## including three 6's off consecutive balls. Ian D finished with a superlative 82*## with Ian M on 41*## and the final score 197-6 - quite an achievement.</p><p> Unfortunately## BWCC's bowling and fielding was not in the same class as Ibstone's## with the praiseworthy exception of Jack Maciver## whose two 5 over spells yielded figures of 5-25.. Several fine catches were held## notably two in the deep by Tom Graham## but other## easier## ones went begging.A stand of 97 for the Ibstone 4th wicket left Ballinger facing defeat with the score on 165-4 with only 31 overs gone. Then the batting started to wobble## and Ballinger sniffed a possible upset.With luck it could have happened## but for another dropped catch## and the odd misfield. It was not to be## though## and the tension was over when Ibstoe sneaked home by 2 wickets off the first ball of the last over of the match## to their great delight## as it was their first win in the MBL Premier Division. </p><p> This was an excellent game of cricket## played in the right spirit by both sides.

477,"""<p> Choosing to bat first against Monks Risborough on a pitch that might (or might not) have been affected by a little overnight rain## with a good deal of cloud cover around## could be deemed a risky gamble. At 30 for 5## the gamble looked a dead loser ! Mark you## at least 30-5 was an improvement on 8 for 3## but even so## Ballinger's batsmen were proving themselves inadequate against a pacy accurate attack which was extracting a degree of lift that they were obviously unused to. Then Monks started spilling catches## and a gritty revival was set in motion by Ian """"lucky x 3"""" Davies## partnered first by Alex Macdonald## then Andy Thompson. From 87-7## when Andy went## the remaining batsmen steadily improved the scoreboard## with Macivers## father and son## giving Davies excellent support. When Davies was 9th out with a valiant 43## with the score on 121## a rather inadequate total looked on the cards. Messrs Lloyd and Adams had other ideas## and their last-wicket partnership added 40 invaluable runs befor Nick was bowled for 26. </p><p> Given Monks' batting feats against us in the past## the match still looked more likely to be lost than won. However## a combination of fine bowling## especially by Adams## (almost) faultless catching (and when was that last written about Ballinger?)## and some irresponsible slogging by Monks' batsmen when they had all the time in the world to win the match## gave Ballinger the impetus to achieve a 70 run victory in a mere 21 overs. Especially noteworthy were catches by Alex Macdonald and Andy Thompson## plus a stumping by Ian Davies (standing back!). Nick finished with 7 for 47 -after two wicketless matches## it's good to report that the great man is on fire again!! </p><p> The pints at the Old Swan afterwards tasted particularly good - now for the league leaders Knotty Green next week.... </p>""",Nigel,2010-03-08

517,<p>Frieth 194 - 9 45 overs BWCC 194- 10 40 oversThis is a difficult game to write a sensible report about.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Frieth won the toss and chose to bat.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Skipper Kerry couldn't believe his luck and with 1st teamer Tom Graham opening the bowling he was quietly confident that tea would be taken early. Unfortunately he hadn't allowed for the vagories of village cricket which meant only 10 players were on view for Ballinger and that Frieth had a batter who had no regard for reputations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once Tom Sperring had woken up and found the right place to bowl he produced an excellent spell ( 5 overs 3 for 10). Harry Rix followed with 3 -26 and with the two spinners Bastie Richards( 1-44) and Tom Branigan (1 -48)doing their bit it was only the the top man who got a pasting(1 -57).</p> <p>Ballinger's reply was led by Richard O'Kelly who looked like a man on a mission. His opening partnership with Derek Richards(21) set the tone. Tim Rix( 15) added momentum and Paul Brannigan(46) helped Richard add 65 for the 3rd wicket. With 160 on the board Richard finally fell but with 8 overs left he should have felt his job was done. Unfortunately Tom Sperring fell in the same over followed swiftly by Bastie Richards both first ball. Paul and Tom Graham then put Ballinger within 8 runs of victory but their skipper didn't do his bit and was out with 5 required. Tom then decided that with 2 required he would shoulder arms to a straight ball. Tom Brannigan sneaked a single off the last ball of the penultimate over. 1 to win## Harry Rix on strike## a wild swipe## middle stump out of the ground and victory had been stolen from us</p> <p>Ties shoul be exciting but when you have lost a game you should have won it's difficult to accept. Still it was fun and a lovely place to play cricket</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It appears that having 12 on Wednesday is no longer a guide to how many may be playing on Saturday. Therefore Nigel has decided to pick 15 for every game on the basis that he might have 10 by match day</p>,,2010-03-08
478,<p> Another toss won## and we elected to bat against top of the league Knotty Green - though had skipper Riley arrived in time## he apparently would have decided otherwise. With the scoreboard showing 33-2 after 20 overs## and having departed for a duck himself## he was doubtless cursing his deputy. However## Knotty Green's opening bowler Widdowson had figures at this stage of 10 overs##7 maidens##6 runs## 1 wicket## and the normally free-scoring Rollo managed one (iffy) scoring shot in the first 47 balls he faced. Paul Humphreys showed what could be done## and had scored 25 of the total of 31 when he was bowled## but in-form Ian Davies was equally shackled for a while. Then a sudden spate of boundaries loosened the bowlers' grip. Rollo started to hit out## with enterprising support in particular from Andy Thompson (29) and Ian Maciver (again !! - 22 off 12 balls). Rollo's 55 was a fine knock in the circumstances## and the final total of 191-9 showed## for the second week running## the value of Ballinger's in-depth batting. </p><p> Knotty Green got off to a rapid start## but were three down for 32 in only the 8th over## with Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson among the wickets. There followed a hard hitting stand of 59 for the 4th wicket## and clouds## both imaginary and real threatened Ballinger## as thunder rolled around the ground## and lightning lit up the sky.The rain started## and for a moment it seemed the weather might win## but the elements relented## and once the main partnership was broken## Knotty Green's under-strength side showed little resistance in the face of Phil Lloyd (4-39) and Ian Maciver(3-18)</p>< A very satisfying win.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
497,<p>BWCC 218-9 Bledlow 188 AO</p><p>Ballinger hosted Bledlow on Sunday and after winning the toss elected to bat first. Humphreys and Draper opened but were kept in check by a tight opening spell by both Bledlow bowlers. Humphreys soon departed for 8 and was quickly followed by Kellock who was run out after a 'mix up' with Draper## leaving the score at a precarious 11-2. This meant Will Smith came to the crease and batted beyond his years frustrating the opposition bowlers and dispatching any bad balls. In the meantime Draper was steadily compiling runs and these two put together an excellent stand of 105 for the third wicket which ended only when Smith was caught for 41. Useful contributions were then added from Max Maciver and Jeremy Hunting who both supported Draper## who eventually fell for a patient 94. Will Rawlinson (23*) and Bastie (12) added some late lusty blows as Ballinger closed on 218-9.</p><p>With 218 to defend## Ballinger had to bowl well and openers Tom Graham and Jack Hankinson did just that by restricting Bledlow to 46-6 with Graham taking 5-28 off 9 overs. The bowlers were also backed up with some excellent fielding with Paul Humphreys## Tom Maw## Max Maciver and Will Smith all taking fine catches. At this stage Ballinger looked on top## but Bledlow's 7th wicket pair had other ideas as they added 101 which got them back into the match## this was however until Jack Hankinson bowled Downes for 65. One more wicket for Hankinson (3-45 off 11 overs) and a run out later the game was wrapped up for a good 30 run victory.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08

577,<p>BWCC 152 AO Gaddesdon Row 153-8</p><p>After Penn Street's cancellation## Gaddesdon Row stepped in to fill the fixture on what looked like a very green pitch. Having lost the toss Ballinger were somewhat unexpectedly asked to bat first but it soon became apparent that runs would be hard to come by.</p><p>With Rick Brockett going early## Will Smith and Paul Humphreys consolidated well adding 54 for the 2nd wicket## but both run and over rate were painfully slow. When Will went for 30## no other batsmen showed the necessary patience on an uneven wicket to stay with Humphreys as GR held most of their catches (8 in total). In the end Ballinger were bowled out for 152 in 39 overs in just under 3 hours. Paul Humphreys and extras were the other major scorers with 53 and 38 respectively.</p><p>With only 152 to defend Ballinger had to bowl well again and both Jack Hankinson and Dom Birkby had the GR openers in trouble straight away. Dom took the first wicket after a high catch from Tom Maw and at 47-5 Ballinger looked in control## with Birkby taking a further 2 wickets## Humphreys taking 1 and George Kingston taking a good caught and bowled. Only Flynn troubled the scorers by edging his way to 25. However this brought O' Sullivan and Tyne together who both survived a couple of close LBW shouts early on. They put on 59 and suddenly GR were back in the match; however when Humphreys claimed the wicket of O' Sullivan## Tyne and J Woof soon followed leaving a tight finish in prospect. Unfortunately a couple more edges were found which went to the boundary and GR crossed the finishing line with the loss of 8 wickets. Stand out bowlers were Dom Birkby who took a 5 wicket haul on his return and Jack Hankinson who perhaps bowled too well and remained wicketless.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
518,Prestwood 188-6 BWCC 188-7</p><p>Skipper Kerry left Prestwood on Saturday with a feeling of another job not properly finished.</p><p> Playing the bottom of the league meant that the selction policy had been aimed more towards the youth end of the market rather than the over 50s end. This is fine if you have 11 players on the field but when one of the slightly older members (18) of the side doesn't turn up because he didn't know he'd been picked that makes life a bit harder.Add to that your opening bowler ( Ben Carlin) breaking down in the 3rd over and you definitely have a problem.</p><p> All the bowlers gave their best but it was difficult to get fielders in the right position when you weren't quite sure where the batsmen were going to hit the ball## and that had nothng to do with where it pitched.</p><p> Evan Webster(10-2-30) and new boy AJ Cooper (12-1-40) were the pick of the bowlers. Rob Rose ( 9-1-39) bowled another tidy spell and Michael Senior added some pace to the attack whilst exploring all areas of the pitch.</p><p> Prestwood's opener## Taylor## scored 71 in their 45overs and as he's 62 there's hope for Derek and Nigel yet.</p> Prestwood ended on 188-6.</P><p> With a limited amount of batting it was important tha Ballinger got off to a steady start. Unfortunately Derek Richards decided to see how far away from him the ball needed to be before he could hit straight to point.Jack Bull(13) then joined Will Smith in an enterprising 2nd wicket stand which gave the innings much needed impetous. When he was out out the score was 43 and the Waggoners were up with the run rate.Kerry joined Will Smith at the wicket and with a mixture of luck and skill slowly worked Ballinger into a good position. Will passed 50 for the 2nd match running and had once more shown incredible concentration and much skill##but had he left his skipper with too much to do? 73 off 13 overs was very attainable but how much batting was left? Michael Senior(14) helped add 21 in 5 overs then Bastie Richards and Kerry put on another 39.The pressure was mounting for both sides and with Evan Webster out on 180 in the penultimate over it was all down to the last over</p><p> Kerry on strike and 9 required to win. 1st ball big swipe and a miss## 2nd ball big swipe and a miss## 3rd ball proper shot and a 6.3 required of 3 balls and what does Kerry do off the 4th ball? He takes a single.This left Rob Rose on strike with the instruction to run at all costs## unfortunately he hadn't been told he also had to hit the ball. Run out! AJ in his first innings has to score 2 off the last ball to win the game. Sadly he only managed a single and the scores were tied</p><p> This Prestwood side were a far better team than we had played against before and although we should have won## there was no disgrace in coming away with a winning draw.</P>,Nigel,2010-03-08
479,<p> Occupation of joint top-spot in the MBL Premier Division was evidently a step too far for Ballinger's batsmen## and the match at home v Downley saw them tumble back to the real world. Matt Riley won the toss## and decided that our recent performances batting first were good enough for him to repeat the process. Alas## our run-machines Humphreys## McIntyre and Davies all had an off day## and the only bright spots in a rather shabby batting display were Matt himself## who played his way back into form after a very lean spell following his come-back from injury## making an invaluable 67## and a hard-hitting 27 by Tom Graham. We failed to bat out our overs## and the total of 146 was never going to worry Downley## who had 48 overs at their disposal. </p><p> Downley's batsmen showed how quick singles can pressurize a fielding side## and although their prolific openers were dismissed relatively cheaply## there was little joy thereafter for Ballinger's bowlers## not helped by some indifferent fielding. A rapid 3rd wicket partnership of 86 destroyed any hopes we might have entertained## and although two wickets fell late on## Downley sailed to 150-4 in only 29 overs. </p><p> Ballinger were deservedly beaten by far superior opponents## and need to bounce back quickly from this set-back. </p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
499,<p>Hyde Heath 213-9 BWCC 170-9</p><p>Ballinger made the short trip to Hyde Heath in what was billed as the big game of the weekend## never mind the Lions or Wimbledon## Hyde Heath was the place to be.</p><p>The day started well for Ballinger as captain Salisbury won the toss and elected to field. Soon both opening batsmen were back in the pavilion relatively cheaply with both Jack Hankinson and Dom Birkby bowling tightly. However this brought Shrimpton to the crease who mixed attack and defence to good effect and punished anything short or wide. He passed 50 in double quick time and held the Hyde Heath innings together as no other batsmen stayed long enough to form a considerable partnership. New boy Carlton Siddle was the chief destroyer bowled a miserly 11 over spell and taking 3 wickets. In the end Hyde Heath closed on 213-9 off 44 overs. Wickets were shared between Birkby (1)## Hankinson (3)## Siddle (3) and Humphries (2).</p><p>After tea the Ballinger reply got of to a great start with the opening pair of Paul Humphries and Will Smith. Both looked at ease on an increasingly friendly batting track and put on 93 for the first wicket before Paul bowled for 53. Unfortunately no one else could get the big score that was required to win the game and when Will was out for 47 it looked like Ballinger would have to settle for the draw## which they duly did ending on 170-9 from 40 overs. Other notable batting contributions came from Kellock (19) and Siddle (13).</p><p>In the end both teams played but in the end it would seem a draw was the correct result.</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
480,<p> Playing at Holmer Green has never been at the top of Ballinger's wish-list## but for once the pitch behaved itself## which is more than can be said for the opposition's fielders## who seemingly pride themselves on a version of sledging from a few of their senior players## who one might think should know better##that verges on the offensive. That said## Ballingers's batsmen## batting first after losing the toss##spent most of their time ducking and weaving against fast and furious bowling## rather than worrying about the verbals. Openers Riley and Kellock had both departed by the time the score had reached 24 off 10 overs## but then Rollo McIntyre was joined by Ian Davies in an initially nervy but increasingly confident stand of 56 for the 3rd wicket## before Rollo fell for a hard-earned 40. Richard O'Kelly was next in## and helped Ian add 91 for the 4th wicket## before he went for an excellent 34. Ian then upped the tempo and was 83 not out when the 45 overs finished## a match-saving knock one might have hoped## giving us a total of 197-5.</p><p> By the time Holmer Green commenced their innings the clouds were threatening## and light drizzle gradually turned heavier## the ball turned into a bar of soap## and our bowlers found nowhere near as much life in the wicket as had the home bowlers. A further disadvantage was an injury to our steadiest bowler## Andy Thompson## which limited him to a mere 4 overs.Two interruptions saw us return in increasingly unpleasant conditions## but the wickets refused to come## a couple of dropped catches not helping. Holmer Green had reached 172 before their second wicket fell## with both K and B King making 50's## and although two more fell in quick succession thereafter## it was too late## and for the second week running we went down by 6 wickets. </p>,Nigel,2010-03-08

503,<p>BWCC 228-7 Amersham Hill 228-5<p/><p>After last weeks no show from the opposition## Ballinger returned to action against Amersham Hill## albeit in a 40 over contest## on what turned out to be a nice sunny day## in complete contrast to the previous day's rainfall.<p/><p>Surprisingly## the ground had dried out well after the rain and Ballinger won the toss and## as usual## chose to bat first. However## this decision looked questionable as after just 2 overs both openers## Phil Lloyd and Jamie Kellock## had perished for ducks leaving Ballinger 4-2. All was not lost though## as Jamie had immediately worked out that Phil had faced fewer balls## thus avoiding the collection of match fees. Staring down the barrel Ballinger slowly began to rebuild with Paul Humphreys (35) and Jack Maciver pushing the score over 50 with a partnership of 53. Jeremy Hunting (25) and Tom Maw (9) continued the scoring## sharing partnerships of 67 and 37 respectively with Jack. Eventually## he fell for a very well made 79 where he was particularly proficient through the leg side. Late order runs from Graham Salisbury (14)## Nick Tegg (11*) and a blistering 29* from Basty Richards helped Ballinger reach 227-7 from their allotted 40 overs.<p/><p>In reply## Hill got off to what one might call an eventful start. Opening batsmen## Hedley## firstly called for the miniature sightscreens at each end of the ground to be moved a matter of millimetres and then secondly asked that Ballinger's Jimmy Gibbs be removed from the bowling attack for bowling 2 over head height no-balls. (Strictly true## but not really in the 'Spirit of Sunday Cricket'). This was not the end however## as Hedley was on his way back to the pavilion minutes later after being run out## trying to take on the tracer like arm of Jack Maciver. Meanwhile## a couple of balls later a very confident appeal for caught behind was turned down. And that was all in Jimmy Gibb's first couple of overs! At the other end Jack Maciver was operating less eventfully bowling a fast accurate opening spell applying pressure to the Hill batting line up. Soon enough 2 wickets had been taken## which brought Mackenzie and Telford to the crease. Early on it looked like both men would be dismissed relatively cheaply but as they survived a couple of dropped catches confidence grew## as did a partnership. Eventually## Mackenzie went for a 63 when he was caught low down by Maciver. Telford## though## carried on his more agricultural approach and bludgeoned his way past 50 and beyond## smashing many a ball out of the small ground and into the gardens. Unfortunately for him## he fell just 2 runs short of a quick fire century when bowled by Maciver. Collins soon followed for a duck (again bowled by Maciver) and Ballinger sensed the game was starting to swing back towards them. However## Joseph played a controlled innings of 29* to guide Hill home by 4 wickets## finishing on 228-6.<p/>,Nigel,2010-03-08
481,<p> One might have thought that bottom of the league Waddesdon## on winning the toss on a damp looking wicket at Ballinger## would opt to field first. Instead## they batted## and indeed batted very competently in the face of a Ballinger attack that was rather mundane. It was only by dint of two superlative catches## first by skipper Riley## then by Phil Lloyd## that the first two wickets were taken## by which time the score stood at 118 in the 30th over. Sadly## Phil injured his shoulder in the process## and with Nick Adams already having done his back in## we were short of bowling resources. Fortunately## Ian Maciver (4-49) was bowling well## supported by son Jack## and Andy Thompson (2-16)## himself bowling gingerly after last week's injury## and a target of 180'ish looked likely until an entirely unexpected assault by R Ullah## a teenager who looked much younger than his years and made 20 off only 9 balls.</p><p> Ballinger should really not have been troubled in chasing a total of 209 to win. However## Paul Humphreys gifted his wicket wafting at a wide ball. There followed an impressive partnership of 108 between Matt Riley and Rollo McIntyre## and when the latter fell for 68## the score was already 123 in the 29th over## ahead of the game. However## the light was deteriorating steadily## and the troublesome Mr Ullah appeared and proceeded to bowl extremely fast. Rain stopped play after 32 overs with Ballinger on 132## now behind on run-rate. 4 overs were lost## but more importantly so too was our momentum. Wickets fell quickly trying to speed the scoring rate## but with the loss of Riley (59) the task was beyond us## and at 167-8 after 41 overs the rain returned and left us with a very disappointing losing draw. </p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
482,<p> Winning the toss at Widmer End## skipper Riley lost no time in asking the opposition to bat on a damp looking wicket.

Then##hooray## Degelas was bowled by Rollo for 57## following which the remaining batsmen collapsed in spectacular style## with Ian Maciver (6-20) the main destroyer## Rollo bagging 2-16## and the innings was concluded in the 34th over for 106.</p><p> Faced with making 107 in 56 overs## Ballinger then proceeded to make thoroughly hard work of the job.

485,<p> BWCC 222 all out Ibstone 195-9 (all out)</p><p> Matches against Ibstone are liable to be high-scoring affairs - the previous fixture was lost by Ballinger defending in vain a total of 197-6## having been invited to bat first## but it was a close-run thing## with Ibstone wobbling badly towards the end of their chase. This Saturday##things went rather differently. Firstly## Ballinger enjoyed their first century opening partnership of the season - Paul Humphreys(60) and Matt Riley (85) putting on 105 together##at a rapid rate of 5 an over## with Humphreys in dominant## if occasionally lucky## form. Thereafter## apart from an attractive cameo 22 from Ian Davies the remaining batsmen all contrived to get themselves out without reaching double figures## whilst Matt held the innings together## being fifth out when the score was 187. Ibstone## fielding only 10 men## held their catches well and fielded impressively## and Ballinger's final total at 45 overs of 222 all out looked vulnerable on a good batting track. </p><p> Ibstone set off after their target as if they had a plane to catch. Despite their losing an early wicket to Nick Adams## the score fairly rattled along## with opener Redrup in magnificent form. Unfortunately for Ibstone their early batsmen were simply too impatient## and courtesy of two fine catches by Charlie Wells## they were soon 60-3## but with only 10 overs gone. Ballinger's under-strength bowling was suffering## with Jack Maciver## unusually## having a bad day even though he bagged a couple of wickets. When the next wicket fell Ibstone had reached 157 in a mere 22 overs## and Ballinger were staring down the barrel. But it was the key man Redrup who perished for a superb 121## clean bowled taking an ill-considered swing at a good delivery from Ian Maciver. That proved the turning point. The Ibstone wobble reappeared## and Paul Humphreys (4-38) and Ian Maciver (1-24) took control## with Nick Adams reappearing to finish with 2-44. </p> <p>Ibstone ended 28 short of their target## and with only 38 overs gone## had they adopted a less cavalier approach## they could surely have made it. A fine win## though## for Ballinger## and one that keeps them hard on the heels of league leaders Knotty Green. </p>,Nigel,2010-03-08

Another avoidable cockup.</P><p> None of the batsmen looked in any trouble but against a tight bowling attack on a very good pitch most got themselves out.

520,BWCC 60- 10 ib 35 oversWaddesden 64-6 in 19 overs<p> If ever a toss decided a match this was it and skipper Kerry wasn't the most popular member of the team when he informed his team mates that they were batting.</P><p> It was dreadful and the home side didn't need the help of some interesting umpiring decisions to make life difficult for the Waggoners. After 16 overs two of the clubs more aggressive batsmen in Peter Petrie and Jeremy Hunting had managed to acquire 27 runs between them. The wicket was drying out and was obviously going to be easier to bat on later but that wasn't any good to us as we all contrived to get out leaving us on only 60.</P><p> This was never likely to be enough and a few lust blows from some of the early Waddesden batsmen made it look even easier but the team stuck at it and and managed to get the home side 6 down again with some help from the umpire. Sadly it was all over in the 19th over and the skipper was to blame!</P>,,2010-03-08
521,<p>Cadmore End 143 -10BWCC 145 - 4</p> <p>Having seen the whole square under water on Friday skipper Kerry was keen to win the toss and let the visitors have first go on what could only have been described as a slow wicket. When he lost but the oppo still elected to bat first he had to ask if he'd heard correctly</p> <p>It was impossible to decide what was going to be a winning score so when the vistors started off at around 3 an over and had posted 50 by the 16th Ballinger weren't sure whether they had control or not. Ben Carlin removed their danger man Dutton and then the first wicket for the 2s for Max Maciver followed by a bizarre run out got Bllinger back in the game. The introduction of Tom McIntyre changed the whole innings. He took 5 - 17 in 5 overs of high quality leg spin. Cadmore were thus bowled out for 143.</p> <p>Cadmore's bowling was some what eratic and the 23 extras helped</p>,,2010-03-08
504,<p>The Lee 164 AO BWCC 138-7<p/><p>On a day when the construction of the Tower of Pisa began 836 years ago and Edward VII was crowned king of the United Kingdom a mere 107 years ago exactly## Ballinger faced their battle Royale as they played near neighbours## The Lee## for only the third time this weekend (both Saturday teams had done battle the day before). The scene was set and so it started## as The Lee won the toss and chose to bat and bat and bat…<p/><p>After an intense pre-match warm up## which didn't include 5-a-side football## Ballinger took to the field with a good mix of youthful enthusiasm and experience and no little confidence after the heroics of both Saturday sides the day before. Jack Maciver took the new ball and was right on the money straight away as he started off with 2 maidens; meanwhile## at the other end Tom Maw operated equally efficiently and was soon ripping into The Lee's top order with his pace and steepling bounce. Well## not really. However## his sedate medium pace did cause a few problems and was rewarded with the wickets of Phelps and Channer. Jack kept up his tight line## but unfortunately## remained wicketless from his first 5 over spell. His replacement from the 'White Hut' end was Jamie Kellock## who rolled back the years to bowl a miserly 9 over spell which kept the squeeze on The Lee's score. However## enter P Neal## ex-Hertfordshire captain and apparently the star of The Lee's batting line up. He quickly moved onto 28 and looked likely to help The Lee recover from a shaky start. But he had not counted on a perfectly concocted plan by bowler Kellock and captain Salisbury which put paid to that. A perfectly disguised longhop was creamed straight to short midwicket into the grateful hands of Salisbury (he hasn't dropped a catch in 4 years did you know?). 3 wickets down soon became 4 as that man## Kellock## did it again as Jones was bowled by a ball that sent the leg stump cart wheeling into the next county. Once the medium pacers had had enough## mainly due to tiredness## the spin quartet where brought on to try and tidy up The Lee's lower order. However## father and son combination of John and Julian Swain had other ideas and they steadily accumulated runs. Jake 'little man' Cutter bowled better than his figures suggested but it was Ballinger's very own father and son combination that finished off The Lee. Max Maciver broke the Swain's partnership as he had John Swain caught by resident slip fielder Paul Humphreys. Soon enough father## Ian Maciver## rattled through the lower order which included Julian Swain for a patient 36. With no sign of a declaration in sight Ballinger eventually finished off The Lee for 164## at roughly 5.03PM having bowled 48.1 overs precisely.<p/><p>After a well needed tea Ballinger set about trying to chase down 164. Usually this would be a score that the home side would be confident of chasing down but a combination of limited overs to do it in and the fact they were 14-3 in the 9th over put paid to this. Young Henry Quinn bowled very well (1-6 off 5) and the slightly older Neal made runs very hard to come by as Ballinger were trying very hard to emulate the success## or lack of it## of the England cricket team. Even the stinging Yorkshire words of Geoffrey Boycott could be heard as star bowlers## Kellock and Maw## were out in quick succession to balls that Boycott's grandmother could have hit with a stick of Rhubarb. Anyway## never fear## Jack Maciver continued his ridiculously good batting form of late and helped add 76 for the 4th wicket before his Dad Ian fell for 37. While Jack made batting look a breeze## further wickets fell with Max Maciver (11)## Salisbury (0) and Richards (0) leaving Ballinger 114-7. However## the injured warrior Jeremy Hunting hobbled out## with the aide of a runner (after pulling a hamstring when fielding)## to mostly pad## and occasionally bat## Ballinger to a well deserved draw. He ended on 6*## Jack on a chanceless 59* and Ballinger on 138-7.<p/><p>On reflection it was a fair result on another scorching hot day for cricket. The local derby that had been billed by the national papers as 'The Clash of the Titans' had ended in a not so memorable draw## but special mention goes to Jack Maciver who took his tally to 105 undefeated runs for the weekend against The Lee. (That will do his average no harm at all!).<p/>,Nigel,2010-03-08
505,<p>BWCC 159-9 Cublington 120 AO<p/><p>Exactly a year ago Usain Bolt broke the 100m world record in Beijing; exactly a year later he did it again in Berlin to become the undisputed king of the track. 32 years ago## to the day## Elvis Presley died at his home and was crowded the King of rock and roll. Sunday's match against Cublington gave Ballinger the chance to welcome back two of their very own royals: Will Smith - Prince of Ballinger and Dom Birkby - King of the no-ball. Anyway## onto the match. After both Saturday sides won## the pressure was on to make it a perfect 3 and this duly occurred when Ballinger recorded an ultimately comfortable 39 run victory.<p/><p>Winning the toss## Ballinger had no hesitation in batting first on a wicket that looked as green as the outfield but defied its initial inspection to play consistently throughout the match. The little and large combination of Prince Will and Paul Humphreys opened up for Ballinger and initially runs were hard to come by as Cublington's opening bowlers bowled generally a tight line. At 20-0## just as Humphreys was beginning to get into his stride## he was adjudged LBW for 11 after a slow death that Rudi Koertzen would have been proud of. Things did not get much better as 20-1 soon became 32-2 and then 42-3 as the well-oiled Ballinger machine began to splutter along as Jack Maciver (10) and Fally (3) fell quickly. Some partial relief then followed as Jeremy Hunting (6) and Prince Will shared a partnership of 26 but when Jeremy was out at 68-4 Ballinger were staring right down the barrel. Joining Prince Will at the crease was Tom Maw and these two steadily went about trying to re-build the innings. Prince Will was batting very sensibly and showed what could be done with a bit of patience and soon enough brought up a very well deserved 50## though not before he hit his first 6 in senior cricket. Those that have batted with the diminutive right hander will know that his life long ambition is to hit a straight six## unfortunately for him it was not a straight hit but one that went sailing over square leg## but they all count. Whilst Will went past 50## Tom Maw supported him and hit a couple of lusty blows in his patient 24 before they both perished trying to go for one big shot too many. However## 62 were added for the 5th wicket and at 130-5 the platform was set for some late order impetus. Unfortunately## this did not really materialise as only Mr No-Ball himself## Dom Birkby## got into double figures with a very useful 16* allowing Ballinger to declare on 159-9. Credit must go to Cublington who managed to bowl 46 overs in the allotted time.<p/><p>After tea## Cublington seemed confident of chasing down the Ballinger total as the pitch was still in good condition. And at first the Cublington freight train was steaming along as openers P Orchard and Burton rattled along dispatching the bowling all around the ground. Once Orchard was out## (to Birkby for 4)## wickets started to fall at regular intervals as the Cublington freight train started to hit the buffers## though at 72-2 they were still in with more than a chance. However## the decision by stand-in skipper Ian Maciver to bring on Humphreys from the 'football ground' end perhaps changed the course of the match. His 4 over spell claimed the vital wickets of Burton## for a stylish 46## Mitchell and Farr leaving Cublington teetering on the brink at 96-7. At this point the spin twins of Max Maciver and Basty Richards were brought on and both showed considerable control and guile in the face of older opposition## slowing the freight train almost to a stop. Max's first over was tight as ever while Basty's shall now be christened 'Basty's magical over'. With one over to go before drinks Waugh was the batsman and Richards the bowler. This was not a West Indies vs. Australia match of yesteryear and nor was it at the MCG or Antigua## but Basty bamboozled the batsmen showing the sort of form that bagged him thousands of wickets last year. With 2 balls of the over remaining## the batsmen feigned to charge down the wicket## undeterred Basty bowled a ball of good line and length and induced Waugh into another false stroke but this time it was a top edge straight into the reliable hands of Nick Tegg at gully. The double figure crowd were in raptures! And to top things off## the batsman's follow through resulted in the bat crashing into his head - that is why helmets are useful. Meanwhile at the other end Max toiled away with absolutely no luck whatsoever## with the ball missing bat## pad and stumps by centimetres on numerous occasions and he certainly deserved better figures than 1-14 off 8 overs. 23 were added for the 8th wicket as Squires and Barker delayed the inevitable but as soon as Max trapped Barker in front for 19 the game was over as Basty polished off the Cublington lower order## the final wicket being that of P China who tried to smash the ball to China but only ended up offering up a chance for Fally to show us his rather good juggling skills before finally grabbing hold of the ball on about the 12th attempt.<p/><p>Overall another satisfying performance with everybody in the team contributing. Brief mentions go to Rick Brockett who kept tidily and Dom Birkby who bowled well to collect 3 wickets on his brief return to Ballinger before going on holiday and missing more games. I doubt we'll see him again. Lets hope this good run of form continues next week as we visit Little Gaddesdon.<p/>,Nigel,2010-03-08
486,"""<p> Monks Risborough 148 BWCC 87 </p><p> Another toss won by BWCC## on a gloriously warm## sunny afternnon## and skipper Ian Davies asked lowly Monks Risborough to take first knock on a green-looking strip## although he must have feared what their famously aggressive batsmen might do to a bowling line-up missing the Macivers amongst other regulars.But as his batting was equally denuded## it was a risk worth taking. As things turned out## the Ballinger bowlers did a good job in restricting Monks to 148 all out in 42 overs## with Ian Davies## surrendering the gloves to Richard O'Kelly## taking 4-32## and Tom Graham mopping up the tail with 3-27. Ballinger excelled in the field## with some smart catches## notably a blinder by Tom Maw##and a neat stumping by O'Kelly (should have been two## rumour has it !) </p><p> After a lonely tea break (the opposition being absent due to the rigours of their Ramadan fast)## Ballinger's batsmen set about what should have been a very feasible target## with 48 overs in hand. Sadly## Monks' bowlers had other ideas## and were far too penetrative for Ballinger's flimsy efforts. Both our """"bankers"""" ## Paul Humphreys and Ian Davies perished rapidly## and although Richard O'Kelly hung on in for nearly an hour for 8## no-one else looked like getting on top of the bowling until a spirited last wicket stand of 30 between 13 year old debutant Josh Livingstone## who made a very assured 22 not out## and Nick Adams (14). 87 all out in 41 overs was a pretty lamentable effort for runners-up hopefuls versus relegation candidates. But that's cricket. Hopefully the return of some of our absentees will give the side more success in the final league match## against leaders Knotty Green. </p>""",Nigel,2010-03-08

506,<p>BWCC 194-8 Little Gaddesdon 156AO</p><p>With considerable pressure to produce a literary masterpiece## the writer has found it a little difficult to write anything of substance this week## but here goes...</p><p>With the Battle of Stalingrad (1942) and the liberation of Kharkov (1943) and Marseille (1944) occurring on this day in history## Ballinger had their own chance to write themselves into the history book as the well-oiled Ballinger machine commenced battle against the 'Gaddenaut'. This was the definition of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object## and as Murray Walker once said “you could cut the tension with a cricket stump”.</p><p>The scene was set: pitch marked out## boundary freshly painted and the opposition warming up (surely not)## but the only problem was that Ballinger had 8 players at 1.50. Finally## with a minute before the scheduled start## Ballinger had 10 players. So now for the 11th… a quick glance at the team sheet led captain Salisbury to realise he would be a man short as an administrative error back at the Ballinger Common stadium had cruelly robbed us of our extra man. Never mind## the game got under way in glorious conditions on what was a perfect day for cricket as the sun was out in a cloudless sky and the pleasant surroundings of the Chilterns provided the back drop. In between the merciless slaying of the Aussies by the English on good old TMS and the occasional complaints from Will Smith at having to bat at No. 3 rather than opening## their was actually a game of cricket going on (who would have thought it?). In form Paul Humphreys and the less in form Jamie Kellock opened up for Ballinger and found the pitch very much to their liking## a batsmen's paradise some might say. Paul was quickly into his stride and looked comfortable while Jamie was less so## although his first scoring shot was a 6. With early nerves dispersed both Paul and Jamie used the massive outfield to full extent and you could have been forgiven for thinking there were two cheetahs running between the wickets as they dispelled any myths about not running 3s## as they did so on 3 separate occasions. This deserves to be repeated for emphasis## PAUL AND JAMIE RAN THREE 3S! They pushed the score onto 116-0## until Jamie (43) holed out to part time wicket keeper/off spinner Odera and soon after Paul followed in similar fashion for 67## being caught at mid on. Will Smith was then the mainstay of the innings with a pugnacious 36## which included loitering outside his crease and tempting the Little Gaddesdon fielders to try and run him out## whilst collecting overthrows when the throws missed! Tom Maw was the next highest with a superb 8* which included a run 4. After 44 overs Ballinger closed on 194-8 and looked forward to what Gaddesdon call 'The Best Teas in The LeagueTM'. They did not disappoint and Ballinger took to the field a little fuller than one would expect of a professional and elite unit such as Ballinger.</p><p>With a decent total to defend and a large outfield## Ballinger's youthful side looked to finish the game before bedtime## and they had a dream start. Jack Hankinson bowled Lupton second ball and then proceeded to terrify one batsman so much that in an attempt to get off strike he ran out his partner. At this stage the rose garden looked… well## rosy but soon enough Marriot and Hodge began to rebuild. As Marriot began to cut loose## Tom Maw smashed his leg stump bail into oblivion and he was on his was for a quick fire 25. This brought Odera to the crease and he made his intentions clear straight away## smashing Rob Rose and Josh Livingstone for some streaky boundaries. The runs kept coming as the ball narrowly avoided any fielder on an increasingly annoying number of occasions. With both batsmen surviving close LBW shouts and the score rattling along## their was only one man to turn to## the old pro Paul Humphreys. Like last week## he turned the game in his 6 over spell as 2 key wickets were taken## including that of the increasingly confident Odera who made a very useful 33. Six wickets down## Little Gaddesdon were by no means out of the game but the combination of Ballinger fielding like Hyenas looking for a kill and Paul Humphreys leaping like a salmon to catch Hodge for 59## the game began to look like a formality. It was duly finished off by Jack Hankinson in the most spectacular way by taking a hat trick (to end with a 5-fer)## although you wouldn't have known it by the muted celebration! So there we have it## the Ballinger machine rolls on with another win and hopefully this will continue next Sunday away at Wendover.</p><p>With everyone retiring to the bar## all that is left to be said is that the game was an enjoyable one## played in the right spirit against very amicable opposition. So therefore## it is very apt to finish this report by quoting English poet Edmund Blunden who once said## “cricket to us was more than play## it was worship in the summer sun.”</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
524,Haddenham 161-10Ballinger 165 -4<p>Ballinger 2s had a comfortable win over lowly Haddenham on Saturday. Skipper Kerry finally managed to win the toss and sent Haddenham into bat.

The introduction of Peter Petrie and then Josh changing ends reduced the run rate and Josh finally sent back Haddenham opener Pawsley. </p><p>Max Maciver ( 4-36) was then brought into action and immediately changed the course of the game. Using the wind cleverly he soon had the home team batsmen in a spin and with Bastie Richards bowling well at the other and Ballinger took control of the game.

488,<p>BWCC 235-9 Knotty Green 136 AO</p><p>127 years ago the defeat of England by Australia at The Oval led to the formation of the Ashes cricket series which is recognised by some## but not all## as the battle for the No.1 test side in the world. 127 years on from that day Ballinger hosted Knotty Green as the top 2 sides in the league met in the last league match of the season to battle it out for bragging rights## but not much more## as league positions had already been decided with Knotty Green being declared champions last weekend. With second place secure## Ballinger looked to finish a good season on a high and this duly occurred with a comprehensive 99 run victory over a Knotty Green side that weren't taking the game quite so seriously.</p><p>Winning the toss## captain Ian Davies opted to bat first and opened up with Paul Humphreys and Richard O'Kelly. They were soon into their stride as Paul especially ripped into the bowling## cutting majestically and driving with aplomb. At the other end Richard seemed happy to play the supporting role but both kept the scoreboard ticking over. The 100 partnership was brought up in the 19th over## but only one over later the first wicket fell as Richard was caught for a tenacious 38. 31 runs later Paul was on his way back to the pavilion after counting his way to 85 and in the process achieved 1000 runs for the season. Rollo then followed for 11 after Irvine nonchalantly caught him one handed and it looked like Ballinger's blistering start may be wasted; however## enter Ian Davies and Andy Thompson## these two added 42 in decent time establishing Ballinger's early dominance. When Ian (26) and Andy (9) departed## Jamie Kellock and Tom Maw helped keep the score moving but it was the late innings impetus from Ian Maciver and Phil Lloyd that really pushed Ballinger to a very competitive score## the last 4 overs yielding a massive 52 runs! Ian finished on 24* off 7 balls## including a 6 that ricocheted off a nice shiny BMW leaving a dent for the returning wedding-goers## and Phil who was bowled for 12 having smeared the league's leading wicket taker## Widdowson## for 2 mammoth sixes back over the bowler's head. Never has such fury been unleashed on a cricket ball in the history of the game. Irvine's bowling was particularly savaged as his 2 overs went for 34 runs## although he did pick up the prized wicket of Kellock.</p><p>A typically good Ballinger tea followed## which this week was provided by Rollo who took the meaning of 'freshly prepared' to the next level by making the sandwiches just before play started. After tea## Ballinger took to the field hoping to replicate the bowling performance of last year's home match against Knotty Green (which incidentally was the last match of the season) where the opposition were bowled out for 139. However## it soon became apparent that they would be helped in this task as Knotty had reversed their batting order. As a result## wickets fell at regular intervals as the lower order batsmen could not handle the fearsome Ballinger attack## with Jack Maciver picking up 3 wickets in his first spell and the irrepressible Phil Lloyd getting 2## one of which## a catch by Jack Maciver which looked about 10 times harder than it should have been## although it would have looked good had the Sky cameras been there. With Jack having bowled his ECB allocation of 5 overs## this brought Andy 'Thommo' Thompson on from the 'football pitch' end and he proceeded to bowl with pace and verve that would have put his namesake Jeff to shame. After three overs he had 3 wickets for no runs and although he did eventually concede some runs## this spell turned the match firmly into Ballinger's grasp## with top order batsmen Widdowson and Mahmood## No.8 and 10 respectively## being two of Thommo's victims. At this stage 9 wickets had fallen with 79 on the board## and Ballinger were as hungry as piranhas in a meat shop to wrap up the win. However## usual opener Hill and Bartlett had other ideas and showed some late resistance that was lacking earlier on as many a batsman got out trying to score off every ball. Patience was the name of the game and with 57 added for the 10th wicket Ballinger superstar Jack Maciver finally bowled Bartlett via an inside edge for 42 to finish things off## with Knotty Green bowled out for 136 in a match that virtually mirrored last year's clash.</p><p>Overall## Ballinger produced a thoroughly professional performance with plenty of energy that befitted the day when Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction 178 years previous. Although Ballinger won the match very little changed in terms of standings as Knotty Green became champions of the Kookaburra Mid Bucks Premier League for the first time and Ballinger secured second place for only the second time. Throughout the season Knotty Green have undoubtedly been the most consistent (and friendliest) side and deserve to have won the league## and although we may look at missed opportunities second place must not be scoffed at. Plus we (may) get a medal to boot. Happy days!</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
580,<p>BWCC 200-8 Wendover 201-3</p><p>In recent times## matches against Wendover have usually been close affairs## but ones in which that Ballinger have eventually come out on top## but Sunday was a different story as they crashed and burned to a 7 wicket defeat.</p><p>After many years of playing Wendover at home due to problems with their Ellesborough ground and its proximity to both the Aylesbury bypass and train line## it was a bit of a novelty to play away## and like the space shuttle Discovery taking off on its maiden voyage on this day in 1984## for many of the Ballinger team it was the first time they had played at the ground. Upon arrival## the distinctive hum of the power lines could be heard and this was supplemented by the occasional passing of a car or indeed a train. Furthermore## for the second week running an administrative error back at the Ballinger Common Stadium had left us with 12 players although this was settled quickly enough.</p><p>With 11 players the cricket could begin as we grudgingly decided to play a 40 over shoot out. Stand-in skipper Jeremy Hunting## on his comeback from injury## won the toss and chose to bat first on a decidedly dodgy looking wicket with the sunny delights of Saturday long gone as the sun and blue sky was replaced by a blanket of watery-grey cloud. Whether or not this affected the Ballinger batsmen## who knows## but they did not get off to the greatest of starts. 1000 run man## Paul Humphreys## perished in the second over and 500 run boy Will Smith didn't fair much better## being trapped in front for 7. Jack Maciver showed what some application could do for a well made 20## but when he was caught and then Jeremy was bowled in quick succession## Ballinger were once again staring down the barrel (it seems this phrase is used nearly every week) at 35-4## and things could have been much worse as Ian Maciver clipped a ball straight to midwicket## when he hadn't scored## but thankfully the chance was put down. So with 4 wickets down for 35 runs in the 15th over a period of rebuilding was necessary. Ian Maciver continued his form with the bat## mixing defence with attack while Tom Maw displayed considerable patience to play the supporting role. Slowly## but surely these two began to pull Ballinger out of the mire with the 50 coming up in the 18th over. As the partnership grew the run rate increased with Ian particularly brutal off the back foot and using the large outfield to good effect to bring up his 50. Eventually## when he was on 62 and the score on 128## the partnership of 93 was broken as Ian was bowled by Seabrook after attempting to hit another boundary. A key feature of the partnership was the running between the wickets with the pair running seven 3s and one 4! Joining Tom then was Rob McIntyre and again a very useful partnership of 59 was added with both players taking a liking for the leg side displaying some shots that wouldn't have looked out of place on a hockey pitch. When Rob departed for a hard hitting 26## a score of 200 was on the cards and this is what Ballinger finished on exactly## an excellent effort considering the predicament earlier in the innings with Tom (54*) scoring his maiden Ballinger 50 - a performance most definitely put down to getting in at 1am after the curry the night before. For Wendover## Burns was the standout bowler with 8 overs for 19 picking up 4 wickets.</p><p>Following another excellent tea## Wendover seemed confident in chasing down the total on what they thought was a batting track. The fearsome Ballinger opening bowlers## Jack Maciver and Jack Hankinson## found the going tough early on as the Wendover batsmen started off in what can only be called cavalier fashion## although Hankinson took the first wicket of Hazelbrook for a rapid 22. With the run rate well above the required rate## the old pro Paul Humphrey was once again called upon to make the difference. Unfortunately## his bowling was treated equally disdainfully and the ball was disappearing to the boundary too often for Ballinger's liking## although their was many a time when the ball would land in front## behind or to the side of a fielder but never actually go to them. Very frustrating. Anyway## Green and Heffard continued their carefree batting## swiping the ball on numerous occasions to and over the boundary and although Max Maciver and Tom McIntyre bowled well neither could get that important breakthrough. So with the smell of victory in the air## Wendover captain## Green## was told he was only 4 runs away from his century and so refused a single off the returning Hankinson so he could hit the winning boundary and wrap up a century. However next ball his leg stump was ripped out and it turned out his teammates were having a bit of fun and Green departed for 75! 2 wickets down became 3 down next ball## as middle stump was ripped out this time and Ballinger thought they were back in with a chance. Crowding the bat to prevent those precious last few runs Heffard smeared one over point to wrap up the win and finish on 82*.</p><p>Overall## it was a disappointing result but## as usual## it was a game played in very good spirit against decent opposition. Maybe we should have looked at the weather before the match as it seemed to be a metaphor for our performance## gloomy for the most part with a couple of bright spots. Anyway## onto next week## away at Chesham Bois## and hopefully a return to winning ways for the Ballinger machine. Anyone fancy a curry Saturday night?!</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
581,<p>BWCC 253-5 Chesham Bois 157-7</p><p>Rollo's grand day out</p><p>The onset of September usually signals the beginning of the end of the cricket season for Ballinger and with only 3 matches left after this one the cut-throat world of selection reared its ugly head as plenty of money changed hands during the week as adults and children alike vied for that all important spot among the elite of Ballinger's Sunday side. As it was## a strong Ballinger side made the short journey to Chesham Bois to attempt to continue their imperious form that has seen the likes of Bledlow and Cublington been savaged by the Ballinger machine.</p><p>With the tree-lined surroundings providing the back drop and the sun occasionally squeezing through the branches to scatter some sort of sunlight on the outfield## el capitano Tom Maw## won the toss and decided to have a bat on what looked to be a decent batting track. Opening the batting for Ballinger was Matt Riley and club pro Paul Humphreys. After a rather circumspect start with Matt playing out a maiden## the second over brought drama. O'Brian's 4th ball swung down the leg side with Humphreys attempting to play the ball down to fine leg for it only to end up in the wicket keepers gloves. A muted appeal then followed as did the dreaded finger of doom## consigning Paul to another week before another attempt to break the record for runs scored in a season. It is not for me to say whether it was out or not## but let's just say Paul was not too happy. Furthermore## there have been reports that current record holder## Danny Draper## was seen to be hiding in the trees surrounding the ground at the time of the dismissal prompting suspicions of serious foul play. An internal investigation has been launched. Anyway## back to cricketing matters## joining Matt at the crease was Rollo McIntyre-Hunting and both soon got into their stride with Rollo especially playing with considerable authority. With each bad ball being ruthlessly dispatched to or over the boundary Ballinger rattled along at a good rate as the 100 partnership was brought up in the 19th over. The mix of Rollo's flamboyance and Matt's obduracy proved to be a perfect partnership## but unfortunately## all good things must come to an end## as the partnership of 115 was broken when Matt was caught for a well made 54. This brought Ian Maciver to the crease and he helped Rollo add 37 for the third wicket in double quick time until he took one swipe too many at Holloway's bowling and was bowled for 8. Will Smith then kept Rollo company for a while until he was caught. Tom Maw then swiftly followed as seeing Paul's anguish at getting out## played a captain's innings to relieve him of collecting duties by getting out to the worst shot in cricketing history as a full toss## which Geoffrey Boycott's grandmother could have hit for six with a stick of rhubarb no less## was tamely hit back to the bowler for a caught and bowled. This dismissal paved the way for Max Maciver to support Rollo McIntyre-Hunting to blast the Chesham Bois bowlers around the park and occasionally into orbit. Soon enough Rollo passed 100 for the second time this season and really began to cut loose with the ball often looking like a dot on the horizon as it disappeared out of the ground. This was not the end## though## as the last couple of overs received particularly brutal treatment. 40 runs were plundered off the last 2 overs as such savagery has not been seen since the publication of William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies'. Eventually Ballinger finished on 253-5 off 37 overs with Rollo McIntyre-Hunting finishing on 148*## a new club record## (of which 130 came in boundaries: 22 fours 7 sixes)## and Max Maciver on a very good supporting 23*. For Chesham Bois## Holloway was the stand out bowler with 4 wickets and Hinks bowled economically as ever.</p><p>After tea the Chesham Bois response began at a rapid rate with 25 coming off the first 2 overs## but as the Ballinger opening bowlers## Nick Adams and Tom Graham## began to find their rhythm the run rate was strangled considerably although no breakthrough came until the score had reached 66. Change bowlers Ian and Max Maciver both bowled very tidily and slowly but surely started to chip away at the Chesham Bois batting order. Clark was trapped in front for a breezy 35 and when Ian picked up his second wicket## that of J O'Brian for 4## Ballinger were back in the hunt. Max soon followed his father's footsteps as he too got in on the act by picking up 2 wickets## the opener Withams for a patient 27 and Kitching for no score## both caught by the strategically placed Nick Adams and Ian Maciver respectively. With Ballinger bowling and fielding well## none more so than Paul Humphreys who prowled the cover boundary with particular enthusiasm and vigour## a positive result looked on the cards. However## they did not bank on stonewall Holloway leading his side to a draw. Although Max continued to toil away with little luck## Alex Howe bowling an excellent ECB restricted 4 over spell where he picked up 2 wickets and the old pro remaining wicketless## Ballinger could not press home their advantage fully (even with 10 players around the bat) and although Nick Adams took another wicket to set up a potentially close finish Chesham Bois saw off the remaining overs with little fuss and therefore## finishing the match on 157-7 off 42 overs with Holloway making 45*.</p><p>So as another match passes and the end of season draws even closer## Ballinger can probably reflect on this match as a missed opportunity but it was a decent game with the major highlight being Rollo McIntyre's majestic and magical 148 not out. Chesham Bois proved to amicable hosts and although the result was not perfect it was good to bounce back after last week's loss. Next week Ballinger visit pastures new as they travel to Jordan Taverners and rumour has it they provide food after the match. I'm looking forward to it already!</P><p>Disclaimer: The views expressed in this report are that of the author and not of the club.

507,<p>BWCC 207-9 Jordans Taverners 171-9</p><p>In 1922 the Great Fire of Smyrna marked the beginning of the end of the Greco-Turkish War. In 2009 Ballinger's match away at Jordans Taverners marked the beginning of the end of the 2009 season as for the first time the start was brought forward by an hour to 1 o'clock. With Ballinger putting out one of the strongest Sunday sides## possibly in world cricket## Jordans Taverners eventually succumbed to a 37 run defeat that perhaps was much closer than it should have been.</p><p>On a rather overcast Sunday afternoon visited Seer Green for the first time to play Jordans Taverners and having lost the toss Ballinger were put in on a pitch that looked like it would deteriorate as the game went on. With the Ballinger line up providing a plethora of riches## the capacity crowd were expecting something special in this 40 over shoot out especially after last weeks fun and fireworks at Chesham bois. Opening up for Ballinger were Matt Riley and Paul Humphreys and the Ballinger innings really set off at break neck speed. 0-0 after 2 overs: tremendous stuff. However runs were gradually accumulated on a tricky pitch and the 50 partnership came up in the 14th over as the run rate began to crawl above 3 an over. Unfortunately record hunter Paul Humphreys was first to go for 31## bowled by Paine## most certainly put off by Danny Draper's appearance behind the bowlers arm. This paved the way for the newly crowned King Rollo and scorer of thousands of runs last weekend to enter the fray much to the joy of the crowd who anticipated another innings of flamboyance and ferocity. It all looked well as his first scoring shot was a 6 but then the unthinkable happened with Rollo bowling bowled for 6and the score on 73. Richard O'Kelly then helped Matt consolidate and slowly but surely the run rate was dragged up with the 3rd wicket partnership reaching 62 until Matt went for a patient 55## an innings that suited the perilous situation that faced Ballinger and which provided a foil for Richard to play his shots. Eventually he then went for a stylish 46 and at 154-4 the platform was set for Ballinger to reach 200. This was indeed exceeded as Jamie Kellock (19) and Nick Adams (16*)## along with extras and dropped catches (which were cruelly laughed at by Mr. Chairman)## helped accelerate the scoring rate with Ballinger eventually finishing on a rather good total of 207-9## a much higher score than initial estimates had forecasted.</p><p>There is one glaring omission from the Ballinger first innings that I have not included though as it deserves its own paragraph. For many years coaches have gone on about how aggressive running between the wickets puts pressure on the fielding side## well there was no better example when openers Paul Humphreys and Matt Riley completed an all run 4## the crowd could not believe it and to top it off there was no dive sight!</p><p>After tea Jordans had the unenviable task of chasing down the target of 207 on an increasingly bowler friendly pitch. Ballinger opening bowlers Jack Maciver and Andy Thompson kept it tight early on and Andy was soon rewarded with the wicket of Leybourne. However it was only after the introduction of Nick Adams and Ian Maciver that the reigns really began to be pulled in and Jordans reply started to hit the buffers. A miserly 8 over spell from Nick ripped the heart out of the Jordans middle order## yielded only 15 runs and 3 wickets while Ian unluckily remained wicketless conceding only 17 runs. At this point victory was virtually assured with 3 further wickets from King Rollo and 1 from club pro and bat supplier Paul Humphreys even despite some absolutely abysmal attempts at catching the small red ball particularly by the captain (yes it was 3 drops). Eventually## Ballinger's victory was wrapped up pretty uneventfully with Andy Thompson finishing with very economical figures and was unlucky to pick up only 1 wicket## while Jeremy Hunting showed plenty of flight and guile in an economical 2 over spell which yielded 40 runs.</p><p>In summary another good win in which Paul was unlucky not to break the coveted runs scored in a season record## never mind there's always next week. Anyway a match against new opposition turned out to be very fruitful with good opposition## good tea and good post match nourishment. Lets hope for another away match next season!</p>,Nigel,2010-03-08
508,On a glorious September day Ballinger entertained Sarratt for the first time in many years. Once all the pleasantries had been exchanged to the ex Ballinger players and opening bowlers from other local clubs (Ley Hill) ## and someone had finally arrived with a key to the pavilion## skipper Salisbury won the toss and elected to bat.</p><p>Openers Humphreys and Riley began the innings in circumspect fashion due to some excellent opening spells from Helm and Lumley. Once they had settled in to the pace of the pitch## which had to be flooded 48 hrs before by the grounds men due to the unseasonal heat wave over Ballinger over the past month (good decision Ian!!) the scoring rate picked up. Humphreys counted himself to 48 which took him past the club record for the most runs in the season## and then decided to ruin the figures of Sarrats top wicket taker this year by taking 23 one over.</p> Paul eventually departed for 73 caught on the 3rd attempt## but this only brought in Rollo## who signalled his intentions by hitting his second ball for 4 and his fifth for 6.Whilst all this was going on Matt was quietly going about his work and reached his hundred with an enormous single## and once the over was finished skipper Salisbury declared with BWCC on 233-1. Matt scored an excellent 101no and Rollo 32no.</p>After the usual Ballinger gastronomic feast Sarratt began their reply but were soon in trouble as Tom Graham 3-30## and Nick Adams 1-23 reduced Sarratt to 46-4.Ballinger's change bowlers kept the wickets falling at regular intervals with Lloyd (2-21) and Max MacIver (4-29) bowling Sarratt out for 125.Top scorer for Sarratt was Randell with 35.</p>An excellent game played in the right spirit## and plenty of jugs down the Swan to finish with.,Nigel,2010-03-08
1,Ballinger had a gentle opener to the season against Chorley Wood on Sunday. Ballinger fielded first and an excellent opening spell by Humphreys and Adams kept Chorley Wood in check reducing them to ? for 3 after ? overs. <br> The introduction of Ollie Richards was interesting with 18 coming off his first over then a double wicket maiden in his second. With Ian Davies bowling well at the other end Chorleywood were reduced to 70 -7. An excellent innings by ? helped Chorleywood reach 171. <br><br>Matt Riley started his season with a well paced innings of 71. Some excellent running between the wickets with Graham Salisbury kept Ballinger in with a shout until the last 2 overs. BWCC eventually finishing on 141- 7 with a very alert Kerry keeping out the last few balls. <br> A difference of 6 overs in Chorleywood's favour probably made the difference but it was very pleasant match played in an excellent spirit. Shame we have to start the league season.,,2010-03-08
2,<p>An almost full strength Ballinger side went to the Nags head ground on Sunday and## in the end## enjoyed a comfortable victory.</p> <p>Batting first Riley & Salisbury got Ballinger off to a slow but steady start but the side slipped to 56 -6 before Lloyd## Fallowfield-Smith & extras brought Ballinger up to 130.</p> Adams & Lloyd then made short work of the Pelicans batting taking 2&3 wickets respectively for a total of 13 runs. Lawson's spin removed another 3 but the prized wicket was taken by pace man Tom Graham when he removed the Pelicans top scorer M.Hull.</P><p>An excellent evening was enjoyed in the Nags Head afterwards.</p>,,2010-03-08
3,The first league game and the question is are we ready? Skipper Matt Riley had a good start to the tossing season when the opposition made the wrong call. Asking Monks to bat first looked like a good choice when## after 20 overs## they had only score 72. Phil Lloyd led the way with 0-14 in his first 6 overs. He was ably supported by Tom Graham with 0-20 in his 6 overs. The introduction of spin increased the wicket taking but## unfortunately## also the run rate. Ian Davies ended with a creditable 3-52 off his 12 overs but Monks Risborough finished on 215-10## which included 37 extras. BWCC set off at an incredible pace scoring 28 off just 16 overs. A 50 partnership between Davies & Hunting gave Ballinger a chance but time (overs) weren't on their side and although Davies reached 85* he was unable to get Ballinger close enough to force the win. Reaching 180-6 meant a loosing draw but by bowling the opposition out## plus batting points## gave Ballinger a reasonable start to their campaign. <i>BWCC 10pts Monks Risborough 15pts.</i>,,2010-03-08
78,BWCC Under 11b's lost a close fought 1st round Cup match against Wendover last Sunday. Batting first Wendover scored slowly but steadily against some tight bowling by BWCC. Wickets then fell at regular intervals with Dan Stockdale picking up 3 catches behind the stumps including one great one-handed effort. Wendover increased their run rate over the last 6 overs of their inning by running & calling well. Harriet Stone slowed the run flow with a great spell including a wicket## but Wendover's best batter took his toll on a sloppy last few overs from Ballinger. Wendover ended on 255 with BWCC having taken 7 wickets. BWCC also off to a slow start in their inning but crucially no wickets were lost. Although behind the run rate BWCC were always in with a chance## unfortunately then two quick wickets did fall which undid all the early good work and with 58 needed off the last 9 overs all seemed lost. However some solid and safe shot making## plus a few extras helped the Ballinger cause and the run rate was kept to 5 or 6 an over. The good news was that all of the batters were contributing to the effort## particularly James and Matthew Rose## Dan Stockdale and Harry Rix. Our last pair## Harriet Stone and Will Clarke needed 21 off the last four overs - a hard ask when Wendover's County player swapped his gloves for the ball but some good calling## quick singles and a few extras kept BWCC in the chase leaving us just 9 to win with 8 balls to go. As often happens when the pressure is on for runs## a desperate attempt at a single resulted in a run out## even then Harriet and Will stuck to their task and took 8 off the last over to cut the final margin between the teams to just 7 runs. The lessons learnt? Practice that ground fielding## think about fielding positions for each batsman and when batting get that calling LOUD and FAST! Well played everyone!,,2010-03-08
85,On a very windy first day of the season Cublington won the toss and decided to bat first. They had a very lucky first over that went for 15 runs. Beginning of the season rustiness by Ballinger bowlers and fielders. Ballinger fought back with some very tight bowling by Harry Wells## Evan Webster and Robert Rose pegging the batsmen back and taking some well deserved wickets. The bowling continued to be tight backed up by some very athletic fielding## the star fielder being Andrew Rishton in the covers. With the last Cublington pair coming to the wickets they were on 225. These batsmen hit the ball hard and scored quick runs. This did not faze Harry Wells who continued with his line and length taking a brilliant bowled middle stump in the last over. Ballinger started their fight back with some patient batting with the first pair of Andrew Rishton and Tom McIntyre. There was some classic strokes in their stand of 15 not out. Harry Wells and Robert Rose continued in the same vein but were really unlucky to be out on their last ball to the catch of the season. Tom Butterworth and Toby King put up some stout opposition but unfortunately lost a few wickets. Rory Seekins and Guyan Ratnavel ran really well between the wickets and gave some lusty blows to take the score to 225. The last pair of Evan Webster and Tom Edmonds came to wicket and with 2 glorious 4's of the first 2 balls by Tom the 245 seemed in sight. A wicket and some tight bowling took the score out of sight. With 15 runs scored off the last over this brought Ballinger's score to 235 and made everyone realise that the catch off the no ball## the LBW not given or the spilt chance was the difference between the teams. The U11C's were gracious in defeat congratulating Cublington and look forward to concentrating on the league.,,2010-03-08
4,Danny Draper made his first appearance of the season for Ballinger today and it looked as though he had put the miseries of last season behind him. Opening with Rick Brockett he scored an excellent 46 but was by no means the leader in an opening partnership of 47. Brockett scored a brisk 23 unfurling a whole range of shots previously unseen by his team mates. 21 from Andy Branigan helped BWCC to reach 174-8 declared. Excellent opening spells of 3-42 by Peter Rushforth & 2-11 by Ian Davies reduced Taplow to 44-5 but BWCC were unable to press home their advantage and Taplow ended on 103-8,,2010-03-08
60,We were unfortunately knocked out of the first round of the cup despite a good first effort from the boys. Top batsmen: Luke Martin 31 (retired not out); and Stefan Otto 15. Top Bowlers: Alex Morgan (2 wickets)## and one wicket each from Privett## Martin & Hutson.,,2010-03-08
51,The game was played at Aston Clinton on Friday 13th May (not a good omen) in bright sunshine. Sadly BWCC had only 9 players and lost the toss. BWCC were asked to bat and their opening bowler quickly disposed of our top 3 batsmen. A couple of badly judged runs which led to run-outs did not help the team. BWCC were all out for 48 with only 14 runs coming off the bat. BWCC bowlers did not have much of a total to defend and Aston Clinton reached their target in 11 overs. Brough and James Stoddart both bowled well and took a wicket each.,,2010-03-08
5,Ballinger enjoyed the short trip to The Lee on Saturday when they gained a comfortable victory over their very local rivals. Asked to bat first Ballinger reached 187- 8 thanks mainly to a far from chanceless 109 by Rollo McIntrye. He was well supported by Matt Riley who scored a dogged 44. They put on 129 for the 2nd wicket which was just as well as no other Ballinger batsman got into double figures. The Lee got off to a flying start but eventually accurate bowling by Humphreys and Adams## who took 3 wickets each## gave Ballinger control and only an excellent innings of 60 from Warren Davies kept The Lee in the game. Spin duo Davies & Maciver with 2 wickets each finished off The Lee innings. BWCC 25pts The Lee 6pts.,,2010-03-08
61,Batting and Bowling orders sorted this time! Some good captaining from Dominic Hutson## particularly with the team one man short on the day - some excellent all-round fielding. An impressive game## and a good start to the season of league games. Aston Clinton 93 all out (.... the last ball being Jack Hankinson's stunning one-ball over in the 15th to knock the opposition out !!!!!!!!) Ballinger 140 runs for 3. Best Batsmen: Luke Martin 32 retired not out; Sam Privett 29 not out## Chris Keen 26 (who decided that wearing boxer shorts with a box meant he'd have to hit 4's rather than run anything !!!!!!!!!!!!!) Best Bowlers: James Stoddart (2 wickets including a stunning caught & bowled .... and he nearly got a 3rd !!!); Dominic Hutson (3 wickets); Sam Privett 1 wicket and Jack Hankinsons (1 wicket off his one & only ball),,2010-03-08
52,The game was played on Tuesday 17th May on a bright sunny evening at Ballinger CG. As some Chalfont players were delayed in arriving## with each captains agreement## Chalfont batted first. Chalfont fielded some good batsmen and they reached 154-2 off 20 overs with Jeff Moxom capturing the 2 wickets. There were good bowling performances from Brough Downey## James Miller and Will Cousins. Sadly many runs were given away with wides## byes and backing up. In reply## BWCC start badly with James Miller being run-out through lack of clear calling between the 2 batsman. Brough Downey batted very well for his 30 runs and held the innings together as wickets fell regularly through the innings. At the end of the innings Lewis Ostacchini batted well for his 13n.o. The low sun in the sky did not help some of the BWCC batsmen - they will have to learn to cope with this.,,2010-03-08
86,Chenies won the toss and put Ballinger into bat. Ballinger did not build on there good batting of last week and managed to lose ten wickets in their 20 overs. This was due to poor shot selection## bad luck and tight bowling. Tom Edmunds and Evan Webster were the only pair to bat through their four overs without losing any wickets. Chenies opened there batting confidently and scored 237 for 4 in their 20 overs## winning comfortably. Congratulations to Chenies and to Xavier Owen making his Ballinger debut. He shows as a 7year old he has quite a future in cricket.,,2010-03-08
68,On a cold## windy night at Shardoloes cricket ground Ballinger under 11A's played their second game of the season. Amersham won the toss and chose to bat. Our opening bowlers Alex Morgan and Adam Robinson put their first pair under a huge amount of pressure and managed to take 6 wickets in the first four overs it has to be said that Amersham were trying to run everything and this proved costly for them! Clever fielding and good positional tactics from George Bartlett the captain kept runs to the minimum with Sam King and Sebastian Richards proving their worth in the field. Wickets continued to fall with George Bartlett## Jeremy Steel## George Bailey and Oliver Lloyd all causing chaos with their accurate bowling. Joe Hankinson was unlucky not to take a wicket but had 2 maiden overs. Wicket keeper Kristian Otto was in fine form evidenced by a marvellous stumping and great run out. He also cleverly left an awesome throw from the boundary by Alex Morgan## which hit the stumps for yet another run out. The highlight of the evening was a brilliant and well-deserved hat trick by Thomas Brannigan. Amersham finished their innings with a total of 143 runs from 20 overs putting Ballinger in a very strong position. After some interesting and heart stopping batting from the opening pair (Kristian Otto and George Bartlett) Ballinger were on 212. The light was fading badly by now and dark rain clouds threatened when Adam Robinson and Tom Brannigan came into bat. This pair really got the scoreboard ticking## scoring lots of runs for no loss of wicket. Despite the rain and continued pressure from Amersham## Joe Hankinson and Oliver Lloyd continued to increase Ballinger's run rate losing only one wicket in their 4 overs. Sam King and Jeremy Steel put on a stand of 30 with Sam finding the boundary 6 times. The rest of the team cheered off the pair. Derek (the umpire) was never going to let bad light stop play with the team in this form and so Alex Morgan and George Bailey went out as the last pair in the gloom of the approaching night. The pair held their own and George was unlucky to be caught on the last ball by Amersham's star bowler. The final score Ballinger 306## Amersham 143. A well deserved win. Thanks to Derek Richards for coaching the team.,,2010-03-08
79,This match showed a big improvement by BWCC and we were always on top. A solid top of the order start from Hamish Elliott and Anthony Mousinho set the tone and useful contributions came from all batting pairs. Key to our decent total was the loss of only 4 wickets in our 20 overs## also the team were more forceful with their shots## selections were better whilst calling and running showed a major improvement - so well done! Useful contributions came from Dan Stockdale## Harry Rix & our Captain for the day James Rose to boost our total to 280. Defending their total BWCC got off to a good side with Beaconsfield finding it hard to score regularly## the match was effectively decided when Will Clark (1-1) and Harriet Stone (2-2) had their spells. They were very well followed by Hamish Elliott (1-2) plus two run outs off his bowling by Will Clark helped up our cause as BWCC picked up 7 wickets during the inning. Overall a very pleasing performance with some big improvements; harder hitting into the right areas## good calling## tighter bowling and very much better fielding with some good vocal encouragement. Well done everyone!,,2010-03-08
80,Hoping for two back-to-back league wins in two days we approached this match with confidence which was boosted when Winchmore Hill batted first and we made a run out from the first ball of their inning. However thereafter WH batted sensibly and lost only 3 more wickets in compiling a competitive 279. WH fielded three excellent batsman who hit the ball hard and choose their shots carefully. BWCC generally bowled well with improved accuracy but could not penetrate. There were bright moments however none better than when Luke Hughes held onto a full blooded pull to square leg - the best catch anyone had seen this season. Batting in failing light on a wet grass wicket on the edge the square meant that BWCC got the worst of the conditions and sadly things got worse from then! Our opening pair lost three wickets and we never got in touch with the run rate. In all we lost 11 wickets which made a huge difference to our run chase. In fairness BWCC improved towards the end of our inning with Will Clark and Harriet Stone adding 22 with no loss of wicket - showing that accumulating runs without losing wickets was possible!,,2010-03-08
62,This was a very comfortable victory for Ballinger. The team are now well organised and playing to their true potential. Luke Martin again batted well and was well supported by Dominic Hutson but all the boys contributed to a good team effort Top batsmen: Luke Martin 25; Dominic Hutson 20 not out Top bowlers: (forgot to write this down from scorebook - tba !!!!!!!!!),,2010-03-08
69,Ballinger Under 11A's turned in an extremely professional performance to beat a talented Winchmore Hill side. Winchmore Hill batted first to score 244 runs. Ballinger bowled extremely well to take 8 wickets. The pick of the bowlers were Adam Robinson## Sebastian Richards and Alex Morgan## each of whom took 2 wickets## ably supported by Joe Hankinson## George Bailey## Mathew Dunnington## George Bartlett and Jack and Max Maciver. Kristian Otto turned in another superb display of wicket keeping. In reply Ballinger Under 11A made 301 runs for the loss of just 2 wickets. Highlights included a ferocious opening stand of 42 runs between Jack Maciver and Kristian Otto. Kristian## in particular## played a superb attacking innings. Each of the remaining batsmen built on this fine start and the innings was completed with a fine flourish from the last pair of Adam Robinson and George Bartlett. Once again Jack Maciver displayed a mature grasp of his role as captain. This was a fine performance by Ballinger Under 11A's and all the boys were a credit to the club.,,2010-03-08
95,On the hottest afternoon of the year Ballinger played Farnham Royal in a crucial double header. We lost the toss but were put in to bat anyway so we were not too downhearted about that. We got off to a very steady start against a disciplined bowling attack## reaching 80 before losing a wicket after 13 overs## with Sam Phillips and Andrew Branigan both making 38. With so few wickets down we could afford to accelerate and did so in style making 73 off our last 7 overs with Olly Richards making a rapid 29 to finish on 153-8 off our 20 overs. In reply they started very positively getting to 93 off 15 overs for the loss of only two wickets. However they then collapsed after some fine bowling by Fergus Hardy## Andrew Branigan and Dan Camp to finish on 113-6. Fergus took 3 wickets including 2 in 1 over## Jono Lacey took 1 along with a couple of runouts. For most of the game this was a tense and exciting encounter.,,2010-03-08

9,Ballinger and Little Gaddesden played out a slightly dull draw on Saturday. A very slow pitch made it difficult for both sides but having been asked to bat first Gaddesden made better use of it than Ballinger. Good running between the wickets enabled Gaddesden to get off to a good start and gave Ballinger's fielders chance to demonstrate their speed of thought and action. 2 quick wickets brought in danger man Barrington who was immediately dropped by skipper Riley. A rapid 34 by Barrington helped Gaddesden to 172. Late wickets by Adams and Davies prevented too much damage. When Ballinger batted Riley's day was made complete by getting a golden duck and BWCC were reduced to 7- 4. Only Humphreys## for Ballinger## was able to overcome the slow pitch with an excellent 57. He and Kerry added 50 for 7th wicket and looked as though a win was on but it was not to be and Ballinger ended on 125-9. BWCC 8pts Little Gaddesden 15pts.,,2010-03-08
81,On a beautiful evening Taplow won the toss and put Ballinger in to bat. Every one contributed with the bat and thanks to the loss of only two wickets and a contribution of 26 from the last pair; Jack Bugden and James Rose a good total of 273 was achieved. On the plus side no one was bowled out - the two wickets being an unusual caught behind off the back of the bat and a run out. The bowling display was good. Harry Rix and James Rose opened and both bowled with good pace each taking one wicket. Will Clark bowled some useful off cutters and took a wicket. Nick Bartington bowled a good spell taking two wickets in his second over. The last pair for Taplow were un done by some good spin bowling by Anthony Mourinho and the deadly accuracy of Harriet Stone who bowled two overs without conceding a run and took one wicket. There were two excellent run outs by Harry Rix and Harriet Stone. In total Ballinger took 8 wickets leaving Taplow on 224 at the end of their innings. So all in all a very encouraging win. Things to work on….. calling and running between the wickets and putting the bad ball away. Well done all the boys and girls who played.,,2010-03-08
54,Thursday 2nd June was a beautiful sunny evening at Ballinger. Unfortunately that was the only good thing about the evening. Marlow Park won the toss and asked the BWCC to bat. Even being 1 player short shouldn't have led to the catastrophe that then occurred as BWCC were bowled out for 15. Marlow scored the runs to win in 2.5 overs. Less the best me thinks.,,2010-03-08
96,Cancelled due to the building of Ark!,,2010-03-08
10,Pathetic was one of the milder words used to describe Ballinger's inept performance on Saturday. Having been asked to bat## the early signs looked promising for Ballinger but a combination of poor shot selection and running ensured a miserable day with the home side being all out for 73 in 28 overs. Broomwade's latest import was too good for Ballinger's middle order. An excellent catch by Kerry and a sharp stumping and catch by Fallowfield- Smith## all off Humphreys## gave Ballinger some hope but 73 was always going to be difficult to defend and Broomwade ended on 75 -3 off 15 overs. BWCC 1pt Broomwade 20pts.,,2010-03-08
88,The Lee won the toss and put Ballinger into bat. Ballinger's opening pair of Tom Edmonds (bowling captain) and Evan Webster batted with authority and put on 27 runs. Next pair Harry Wells and Robert Rose continued in the same positive way and put on 13 runs. Guyan and Rory then mixed defensive and adventurous batting to add a further 24 runs. Xavier and Andy had to cope with widely variable bowling but kept their heads to add 2 runs. The final pair Tom McIntyre and Tom Butterworth played some fine strokes and ran well adding a further 16 runs. 284 for 2. Ballingers fielding was excellent with every bowler taking wickets apart from Harry Wells who made up for it by taking 2 of the most stunning catches seen at any level of cricket. Tom McIntyre (fielding captain) kept wicket impeccable throughout. The Lee's final score of 208 for 11.,,2010-03-08
11,A bad weekend was completed at Ballinger when they were easily beaten by Albury Entertainers. . Batting first Ballinger were unable to capitalise on an excellent stand between Andy Branigan & Ian Davies both scoring 40s## collapsing from 90-2 to 136-10. Some sloppy fielding by Ballinger## apart from a brilliant run out by Davies## enabled Albury's opener Ellis to score 57 and they reached Ballinger's total for loss of just 2 wickets.,,2010-03-08
72,Ballinger Under11A's produced their finest performance of the season to defeat a strong Cublington Under 11 side. Particularly pleasing was the manner in which the side recovered from a difficult start to the innings. Ballinger batted first and the opening batsmen faced some aggressive and accurate bowling from Cublington which reduced Ballinger to 197 runs after 4 overs. Ballinger dug deep and produced a number of fine partnerships## Joe Hankinson and Sebastian Richards (23 runs)## Max Maciver and Mathew Dunnington (20 runs)## Alex Morgan and George Bailey (21 runs) and a final flourish from the two closing batsmen## Adam Robinson and George Bartlett (36 runs). This was a fine fightback by Ballinger and particular praise must be given to Max Maciver for his mature innings and to Adam Robinson for his aggressive batting at the end of the innings. Cublington## in reply## were restricted to 215 runs for the loss of 11 wickets by some tight Ballinger bowling. All the bowlers made significant contributions backed by another superb display of wicket keeping by Kristian Otto. Pick of the bowlers were the opening bowlers## Jack Maciver and Alex Morgan. Jack Maciver in particular bowled a superb hostile opening spell. Special mention must go to Mathew Dunnington who bowled superbly to take 4 wickets## including 3 wickets in one over. The day belonged to the whole team## each of whom made a vital contribution to the victory and the team was splendidly captained by Jack Maciver.,,2010-03-08
45,There were some unusual names in this U15 side## which included three U12s & one U13. It didn't make any difference## as Ballinger were still too strong for Wendover. Batting first a very composed innings of 42no from Nick Rose plus a brilliant innings of 33 from James Wood## in his first appearance for the U15s## helped Ballinger reach 126-4 off their 20 overs. Another new boy James Stoddart bowled a very tidy spell taking 2-18 but Fergus Hardy did most of the damage with a spell of 3-5. Wendover finally reached 109-8.,,2010-03-08
97,In another close fought encounter between these clubs Ballinger just squeezed home off the penultimate ball. Batting first Kingshill reached 130-5 thanks mainly to 61 no out by Major. Only Crick and Macdonald caused the Kingshill batsmen any problems taking 2 wickets each. Then Crick & skipper Charlie Wells opened up for Ballinger and paced their innings perfectly. Kingshill used 8 bowlers in an attempt to remove one of these two but to no avail and with the help of 29 extras## 68 from Crick & 34 from Wells Ballinger sneaked home.,,2010-03-08
64,Another comfortable victory for the boys although losing 6 wickets in chasing just 60 isn?t good for the coaches nerves but reaching Chesham's score in 15 overs helped soothe them. Some extraordinary wicket-keeping from James Wood with 2 catches## 2 run-outs and a stumping - great to have him back in the team after recovering from a broken collar-bone !! Best batsmen: Stefan Otto 25; Dominic Hutson 17 Best bowlers: Richard Wise 3 wickets## George Bartlett 3 wickets,,2010-03-08
98,This fixture was rescheduled to enable the Cup match against Tring Park to be played. Sadly we were unable to re-arrange it to fit in with tournament organiser's schedule and they called it an abandoned game.,,2010-03-08
12,Ballinger's woeful season continued at the weekend when they suffered another heavy defeat. Having asked Widmer End to bat it looked like they were going to have to chase a huge target when Widmer reached 130-3 with 20 overs to go. Then an excellent spell by Davies and 2 brilliant catches## by Whelan and Adams enabled Ballinger to bowl Widmer out for 182 in 37 overs. The extra overs should have been a bonus to Ballinger sadly all that happened was that Widmer had longer to bowl them out. A poor pitch didn't help Ballinger's efforts but all out for under 100 two weeks running is relegation material. BWCC 6pts WESM 25pts.,,2010-03-08
13,On Sunday Ballinger had a very enjoyable game against The Scuttlers. Batting first the Scuttlers quickly rattled up 199 - 4 with no Ballinger bowler able to make an impression. Jeremy Hunting led Ballinger's reply with 41 before being brilliant caught by Kerry. Davies (47) & McGowan (20) kept the score moving but a fine spell of bowling by Kerry kept them behind the clock. 175-9 was a good effort but BWCC can thank their umpire for staving off another defeat at the hands of the Scuttlers.   ,,2010-03-08
82,A much changed U11B's batted first and started well## posting 216 for the first pair## but wickets then tumbled fast. In all 13 wickets fell## mostly to straight balls and lobbed catches. This was disappointing as we have practising playing each ball on its' merits and using our feet better. The team were a little low as we changed over and when we started fielding things improved quickly. We bowled straighter and fielded really well - Luke Hughes taking a great catch a short extra cover supported by a catch in the slips by Will Smith and a couple of test book run outs. After 16 overs we had taken 8 wickets and pegged Gt Kingshill back to under the 200 mark and any result was possible. Sadly the last Kingshill pair got after us a bit and our offensive fielding positions leaked a few runs - a good gamble that did not quite come off. All the same an exciting game with the result in the balance until the last over. Lessons learnt? Losing 6 runs from a lost wicket is expensive## so patience and concentration is as valuable as the big hits! We all agreed after the match that we would win next time!,,2010-03-08
15,An unbeaten 70 by Jeremy Hunting got the Waggoners rolling again on Saturday. Ballingers bowlers did an excellent job of keeping Lacey Green down to 156-9## with wickets been spread between Lawson## Humphreys## Maciver & Lloyd. Then even the loss of Matt Riley## to yet another golden duck## and the high temperatures were unable to stop Hunting and Humphreys(51) passing Laceys score with nearly 12 overs to spare. BWCC 20pts Lacey Green 6pts.,,2010-03-08
16,Two excellent spells of spin bowling were too much for Bledlow on Sunday. Fergus Hardy 4-31 & Andy Branigan 3 -38 were well supported by Jono Lacey 1-7## Rhodri Webster 2-6 and a master class in tight bowling from Nick Adams. The 112 Bleldow scored was never going to be enough on a good track and Ballinger duly passed their score with 4 down. Two making their season debuts Tom Wells (27) & Nick Rose (25) led the way with Rhodri Webster making it all look very easy.,,2010-03-08

17,In a nail biter at Ley Hill on Saturday## Ballinger managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Asked to bat first Ballinger were soon in trouble on a difficult wicket but a typically gritty innings from skipper Riley (44) and another flamboyant knock from McIntyre (46) managed to dig BWCC out of trouble. Sadly the 169 Ballinger finally limped to was always going to be difficult to defend on such a small ground. A superb opening spell by Humphreys of 5-11 gave Ballinger some hope and reduced Hill to 44-5. Then a courageous 63 from Leadbetter put Hill back in it## but wickets were still falling and Ley Hill were 9 down going into the last over still needing 3 to win. A boundary off the first ball ended an exciting game.  BWCC 8pts Ley Hill 20pts,,2010-03-08
18,An excellent bowling and fielding display by a young Ballinger side## including 5 catches by Rhodri Webster## wasn't enough to beat Penn Street on Sunday. By bowling Penn out for 140 it looked as though the Waggoners were in for an easy afternoon sadly their batting didn't match up to the bowling and they were dismissed for a disappointing 123. At on stage Ballinger were 52-5 and only a stand of 70 by skipper Davies and new boy Dom Birkby enabled Ballinger to get close.,,2010-03-08
76,Farnham Common batted first and made 199 during which Ballinger took 10 wickets. Pick of the bowlers were Charlie Mead and Joe Hankinson## each of whom took 2 wickets## and Jack Maciver who accounted for 3 wickets## They were well supported by Alex Humphrey and Sebastian Richards who each took a wicket apiece. Once again Kristian Otto showed what a good wicket keeper he has become. Ballinger replied with 343 runs for the loss of 5 wickets## of which the highlights were a superb display of hitting by Sam King who made an unbeaten 32 and an extremely classy innings at he death by George Bartlett who showed excellent technique in his unbeaten score of 29 runs. All the batsmen contributed in a typically aggressive batting display with Jack Maciver and Kristian Otto contributing 18 in their 4 overs## Joe Hankinson and Sebastian Richards18 runs in their 4 overs## Sam King and Charlie Mead making 41 runs in their partnership## George Bailey and Alex Humphrey contributing 27 runs and an excellent final partnership between George Bartlett and Alex Morgan of 39 runs. Congratulations to all the boys for their contributions during the 2005 league season.,,2010-03-08
48,Match abandoned due to total darkness only brightened by regular lightning strikes.,,2010-03-08
66,This was incredibly exciting match to finish off the league season for the boys. Just to trying to get any match in last week was an effort with the continuous rain! However## with plan 13.f. in place from moving the game to Sunday and then back to the Friday again## we had a good strong team out. Gt Kingshill have won every single one of their U13 matches this season## so we knew we were going to be up against some really stiff competition.   GK had a particularly strong couple of batsmen## so I was particularly glad he had to retire at 30!  They reached 125 for 8 wickets (2 great run outs) - our boys put up some splendid bowling: particularly James Stoddart with 3 wickets## and Richard Wise## Luke Martin and Dominic Hutson with 1 each. Only 14 extras given away (7 bowling## and 7 byes/leg byes). Our boys opened well## but the run rate was a slow## leaving a lot to do. Although we benefited from 31 extras (mostly byes)## it wasn't until James Wood joined Dominic Hutson at the crease## that things really started to get exciting. James batted in his usual expert way hitting 2 fours## and a magnificent 6 straight out of the grounds. Both James and Dominic scored 28 each before being bowled. Luke Martin did well on 10 runs## and Sam Privett on 8. James Stoddart and Richard Wise came in as the light was fading fast (miserable rain clouds)## and the scores were getting closer. Three runs were needed off the last ball to tie (in which case Ballinger would have won on wickets) - they managed to score 2 runs off the final ball## leaving Gt Kingshill to win by just 1 run !!!!!!!!! (Not dissimilar to the match the following day at Lords between England and Australia - down to the last ball## and just that tiny bit too much to do too late!) Well done boys - I'm proud of the way you have all played all season - you've been great fun to work with as always## and I've seen a huge improvement in the batting from everyone!!. Here's to next season when you all become proper U13's !!! Wendy.,,2010-03-08
19,BWCC found itself on the wrong end of another nail-biter against Hawridge on Saturday. Hawridge were put in on a damp pitch and through some excellent bowling particularly from Davies were reduced to 82 for 7. However the Hawridge tail “wagged” and scratched its way to 171 all out. The Ballinger top order made a poor start. Then coming in at number five## Ollie Richards made a brilliant 70 to get The Waggoner's into a winning position. With 9 down going into the last over## and only 3 runs## required any result was possible. Sadly a dramatic run out gifted victory to Hawridge thus spelling heartbreak for Ballinger for the second week in a row as they came up short by 1 run. BWCC 9pts Hawridge 25pts.,,2010-03-08
20,Another good fielding effort by this young side kept Longwick down to 140 in their 40 overs but once again the batting was poor and Ballinger were all out for 90.,,2010-03-08
101,A brutal innings of 72 from Jono Lacey smashed Ballinger into the final of the Bucks Cup on Wednesday. Jono denied to score singles choosing the more direct route of eleven 4s & three 6s. Ballinger had been given a steady start by openers Phillips & Lowe## who put on 44 for the 1st wicket## but when they went in quick succession and were followed unluckily by skipper Richards it was left to Lacey and Camp to destroy Buckingham. Their partnership of 94 in 8 overs was thrilling to watch and helped Ballinger to 165. Then Lacey## opening the bowling## produced a blistering spell of fast bowling taking 3 - 14 in 4 overs but the bowling plaudits really belong to Charlie Wells who mesmerised the Buckingham batsmen taking 4 - 21 in his 4 overs. Skipper Ollie Richards was very pleased with the team's performance and was looking forward to the final when Ballinger take on Burnham.,,2010-03-08
21,BWCC 7pts Monks Risborough 25 pts.,,2010-03-08
23,Ballinger scored a comfortable win over local rivals The Lee on Saturday. The Lee won the toss and decided to bat. An excellent opening spell of 3 for 17 from Tom Graham soon put The Lee on the back foot and their troubles continued as the spinners were introduced. A devastating spell of 5 for 5 by Ian Davies rolled The Lee over for a paltry 64. Ballinger were clinical as they set about cantering home before tea with skipper Matt Riley steering his team over the line with 26 not out. BWCC 25pts The Lee 1pt.,,2010-03-08
25,BWCC 3pts Holmer Green 20pts,,2010-03-08
27,Ballinger had a comfortable win over bottom of the table Lt.Gaddesden on Sat. Having been put in Ballinger abstained from their normal crawl at the start of an innings and galloped to 50 off 10 overs with Kerry encouraging skipper Riley to run the occasional single. Once Kerry was out though the run rate really accelerated with Draper back to top form and scoring an excellent 102no. This plus 65 from Riley and a very rapid 41no from McIntyre took the Waggoners to 240-2. A wet ball prevented Ballinger's bowlers from ever really dominating but Lawson's 5 wickets and another tight spell of 2-11 from Humphreys was too much for the Gadd with them all out for 190. BWCC 25pts Little Gaddesden 5pts.,,2010-03-08
28,Ballinger completed an excellent weekend with a win over Chesham Bois. Batting first Chesham Bois were bowled out for 108 with off-spinner Fergus Hardy doing most of the damage with 4-17. Rhodri Webster guided Ballinger home with a well crafted 57 as the Waggoners reached 109-2.,,2010-03-08
29,Ballinger took on league leaders Broomwade on Saturday and current form suggested a heavy defeat for the Waggoners. Once again they confounded their critics by putting in an excellent bowling and fielding display which kept Broomwade down to 176. Ian Maciver## with his first 5 wicket haul of the season## led the way but he was well supported by some excellent catching## particularly by Whelan. Kerry made an important breakthrough when his under utilised off spin accounted for Broomwade's latest import. A little more ambition from Ballinger's early order batters may have helped the Waggoners get closer to Broomwade's score but Broom's excellent seam attack gave Ballinger no chance of causing an upset and they had to be happy to settle for a draw finishing on 128-5. BWCC 8pts Broomwade 14pts.,,2010-03-08
30,A strange event took place at Ballinger on Sunday when the Waggoners played Monks Risborough in a 40 over game. Agreeing to play a limited overs format has seen many captains hauled before the committee even though it may have been an away game but agreeing to play one at Ballinger could well be a flogging offence. The Club President## Gerry Hunting## who was at the ground to check out the offering of Ballinger's' latest recruit to the Tea Lady rota## was apoplectic and was telling anyone prepared to listen that it wouldn't have happened in his day. Fortunately no-one was prepared to listen. The game revolved around another excellent bowling and fielding display by this young Waggoners side who kept Monks to 193-10. Olly Lowe(3-34) and Tom Graham(3-37) bowled exceptionally well. Unfortunately skipper Davies allowed Ben Whelan 2 overs because it was his last game of the season. 34 runs later Davies realised that there's no place for sentiment in this game Ballingers reply started awfully with 3 wickets falling in the first 8 overs Davies and Wells batted well and a late flourish from Tom Graham and Alex MacDonald kept Ballinger up with the run rate but sadly they lost wickets too quickly and ended 22 runs short.,,2010-03-08
33,Ballinger eased their relegation worries on Saturday with a comfortable win over Lacey Green. Batting first the Waggoners reached 155 - 7 with the main contributions from Riley(32) & Davies (43no). Then expert use of the old ball by Maciver with 4-31 & Lawson 3-24 reduced the Green to 79-8. Two balls with the new ball was all that Adams needed to finish off the tail with Lacey Green 83-10. BWCC 25pts Lacey Green 4pts,,2010-03-08
34,Ballinger were invited to bat first against The Minn on Sunday a decision their skipper probably regretted when the Waggoners' openers Webster & Phillips added 121. This was followed by a rapid 23 from Richards and a stand of 70 between Davies (50no) & Tivey (25no) enabling Ballinger to declare on 240-3. Despite a spell of 3-0 in 4 overs from skipper Davies## Ballinger were unable to winkle out the Minn batters and they finished on 149-6.,,2010-03-08
35,BWCC fielded a very much under strength side supplemented by a number of colts (3 of which were asked to play 5 minutes before the start of the game). However## those asked to feature in the top 4 all contributed with the bat## even the somewhat elevated No. 3 James Fallowfield-Smith who chipped in with a useful 20!! Openers Humphries and Riley scored at nearly 5 an over before Humphries became the fist of 3 wickets for Lown who claimed all of the top 3. Davies looked to push the score along and looked set for a big score before being brilliantly caught on the long-off boundary by a guy who (he was reliably informed) had not taken a catch all season## his innings ending on 29. N. Adams then “joined” the party walloping the opening bowler back over his head for two huge sixes and finished 20 not out. In reply BWCC's miserly opening pair immediately removed the top three without greatly troubling the scorers. Ley Hill's numbers 4 and 5 however had other ideas looking to bat positively and scored at a rapid rate before Davies struck twice to remove both. Ley Hill were always in the hunt after this## scoring at the required rate before Lawson produced a masterclass in slow left arm bowling to mop up the rest of the side finishing on 5 - 37 with the Hill trailing by 44 runs. BWCC 25pts Ley Hill 6pts.,,2010-03-08
36,Another fine display of bowling and fielding from Ballinger's youthful Sunday side saw Wendover dismissed for a low score of 128 on a good batting wicket. Davies and Hardy did most of the damage bowling 19 overs between them and taking 6 - 37## before Crick and Kellog came on to mop up the tail. Chris Mitchell## making his senior debut behind the stumps## took an excellent catch off Crick. In reply Andy Branigan batted solidly for his 44 before being stumped## while Kellok flailed his bat for a quickfire maiden half century for the club (It had to be quickfire as a severe case of cramp set in after running one too many 3's!!). BWCC suffered a mini collapse shortly before the end (similar to the game being played at Trent Bridge## ironically with the same target to chase) but the experienced I. Hardy saw the Waggoner's home with 5 wickets to spare.,,2010-03-08
50,Ballinger's U15s ended their season in style with a comfortable win over Beaconsfield in the league Cup final last week.. Batting first a good team effort enabled them to reach 123-6## with the main contributions coming from Lowe## Crick & Camp. Then tight bowling and excellent fielding enabled skipper Richards to keep the pressure on the Beaconsfield batsmen with only Rory Mcarthy (50) making any impression in their total of 90-6. Coach Nigel Kerry said the boys were disappointed to lose to Burnham in the BCB Cup final## so were even more determined to end the season on a high. Team - Ollie Richards## Charlie Wells## Fergus Hardy## Richard Page## Ollie Lowe## Sam Phillips## Dan Camp## Chris Mitchell## Jason Stone## Nick Rose## Tom Crick & Andy Branigan. Coaches Nigel Kerry & Ian Hardy,,2010-03-08
37,An unusual occurrence happened at Hawridge on Saturday when Ballinger's league season ended with an enjoyable game against their local rivals. Batting first Hawridge reached 244 - 6 off their 45 overs thanks## in some part to 8 dropped catches## and an excellent innings by Rifai (68). Will Hunting was a man in a hurry scoring 51 in 25 minutes to give the Waggoners the start they needed he was helped by another belligerent innings from Mcintyre (61) but only Adams (25) of the later batsman could cope with the spin of Rifai. It went to the wire though with the Waggoners being bowled out for 209 in the 45 over. BWCC 8pts Hawridge 25pts,,2010-03-08
38,Sunday's game at Ballinger belonged to the Birkby brothers. An excellent catch by skipper Kerry set elder brother Dominic on the way to his first 5 wicket haul (6-44) in senior cricket. He was well supported by some excellent ground fielding & a sharp spell (2-25) from Fallowfield-Smith with Fulmer ending on 171-10. Salisbury (50) & Fallowfield-Smith (45) set about this target with great gusto but it was Ali Birkby (26*)## making a guest appearance## who led the Waggoners home in style.,,2010-03-08
39,Winning the toss and batting first is the usual ploy on Sundays but on a damp wicket in September against a strong Beaconsfield side it may not be the right decision and so it proved on Sunday. Only opener Riley(26) and Andy Branigan(44) were able to make any progress and Ballingers final score of 148 always looked to few. When Beaconsfield batted the Waggoners were looking for some early wicket from Adams. He duly obliged but unfortunately it brought in Carter who proceeded to smash the Ballinger bowlers to all parts of Beaconsfield. His 84 helped Beaconsfield pass Ballinger's total in just 21 overs. The only high point for Ballinger was the rare appearance in the scorebook of “ Bowled Hardy - Stumped Riley”  ,,2010-03-08

41,On a beautiful early autumn afternoon Ballinger started their last match 2 short. Team secretary Kerry was heard cursing email/mobiles/BT and colts in no particular order. Fortunately Ali Birkby was on hand to fill one of the slots again. Perhaps we ought to pay Chesham a transfer fee for him. Batting first on a very difficult wicket The Waggoners were soon in trouble when Hunting was brilliant caught in the gulley. Riley& Davies followed shortly and it was left to Maciver(44) and Kerry(25) to rebuild the innings. Another brilliant knock by Birkby(34) helped by a battered Kellock helped the Waggoners reach 161-5. Penn St set off in a very positive manner but Ballinger's spinners soon held sway with Fergus Hardy bowling a marathon spell of 19 overs taking 5-70. He was helped by Davies(3-21) & Maciver (2-4) and Penn were bowled out for 121. A very pleasant end to the season.,,2010-03-08
40,This was a very strange game. It looked likely at one stage that Ballinger were going to dismiss the Weekenders relatively cheaply but then their No6 played an extraordinary innings during which he played and missed## heaved and missed## heaved and hit and somehow ended up with 86*. Skipper Davies used seven bowlers all to no avail and the Weekenders finished on 226 - 5. Rick Brockett(21) & Jeremy Hunting(27) gave the Waggoners a good start but it was Davies(74) who took the attack to the opposition. Then the light deterioted so much that umpires Hunting & Hunting had to ask the opposition to bowl their slow bowlers if they wanted to continue the game. Unfortunately Davies decided to keep hitting these bowlers for 4s so the Weekenders brought back their quickies at which point amid much grumbling the umpires called a halt. All was well in the bar afterwards - unlike a league game I suspect.,,2010-03-08
669,<p>Ballinger U11s started their season with a friendly against the girls from the Bucks U13 squad on Sunday. Following 3 weeks of beautiful sunshine the weather was dreadful  presumably because it was the first game of the season.</p><p>Ballinger skipper James McIntyre won the toss and chose to bat. Tom Petrie and Brandon Alan opened the innings and after an uneventful first over## Brandon was out first ball in the second. Freddie Thompson then joined Tom and these two batted beautifully striking the ball all round the wicket and this was against some very useful bowling from the girls. The two U10s added 52 for the 2nd wicket before being retired. James McIntyre then added a cultured 12 and with Freddie Sanders## Max Firth and Will Arnold took the score to an impressive 85  3 in the 20 overs.</p><p>Once in the field Waggoners skipper McIntyre had decided on a strategy of spin from one end and pace the other. Thus he opened with Will Arnold and new boy Joe Turrell and the plan soon paid dividends as by the end of the 3rd over the Bucks girls were 2-1. James then rang the changes with all the bowlers having a two over spell and all bowling well. The highlight of the fielding was another excellent display behind the stumps by Brandon and a brilliant catch by Ollie Fretton.</p><p>Bucks Girls ended on 76-8 in their 20 overs  Not as close as it looks</p><p>A very enjoyable game played in an excellent spirit by both teams.</p><p>No stats will be shown for this game as it was a friendly and more than 11 players were used by both sides.</p>,,2010-05-01

Alas## the team performance was hardly the start BWCC were looking for in their quest for more## and better## silverware.</p> <p>The loss of the toss seemed to matter little to openers Riley and Humphreys## who got the innings off to an excellent and surprisingly(for BWCC) rapid start## putting 56 on the board by the 15th over## when Paul fell for 20. WESM&rsquo;s bowlers were accurate and gave little away## their fielding was sharp## and the BWCC middle order were soon struggling## the 4th wicket going down at 86. Then Andy Thompson(26) joined Matt and they put together a stand of 58 before Andy danced down the wicket to spinner M Khan## but omitted to lay bat on ball## and departed stumped## in the 40th over. Going for quick runs ## the wickets clattered## and in a somewhat disappointing total of 169-9## Riley top-scored with an excellent 77.</p> <p>By tea time the sky was darkening## and with heavy rain forecast## the WESM batsmen had evidently decided to make haste## which they duly did with crushing effect. Opener M Khan (yes## him again) deposited his first ball over extra cover for 6## seriously endangering the scorers as it crashed into the pavilion window## and he and G Pearson had put on 95 in only 19 overs before the first wicket fell. BWCC grassed two catches## and their fielding was somewhat less than sprightly. As the sky grew steadily blacker and the 6&rsquo;s flew out of the ground## all our hapless bowlers could do was to invoke the rain-gods. Their prayers were indeed answered &ndash; too late. Five minutes after WESM cantered home in the 27th over the heavens opened.</p>,,2010-05-04
670,<P>Ley Hill won the toss and put Ballinger in on a slow track. Ballinger made a steady start against some good accurate bowling from the Ley Hill opening bowlers. However## it was one of the first loose balls that saw Ballinger lose their first wicket when Derek Richards fell to a good catch at cover. This brought Tim Rix to the wicket and he hit an explosive 21 while wickets were falling around him but he got beaten by the flight of the impressive Ley Hill spinner Wilson who took 4 wickets. Sebastian Richards was out shortly after and this left Ballinger at a precarious 38-5. A good partnership between Peter Petrie and Nigel Kerry steadied the ship to a degree but when Petrie was out Ballinger were still only 76-6. Nigel continued going and was unbeaten on 51 at the end and he along with some stout resistance from the Ballinger lower order consisting of Max and Ben Dugdale## Evan Webster and Monty Thompson. It was a good recovery from Ballinger especially against a very good Ley Hill attack. </P> <P>Ley Hill started well in response despite a dangerous opening spell from Evan Webster and when Ley Hill number four Aspuith hit two consecutive sixes off Tim Rix the score was 69-2 and it looked as if Ley Hill were going to cruise to victory. However## Rix fought back and in the same over as the two sixes Aspuith skied one in the air and Sebastian Richards took the catch. Tim removed the Ley Hill anchorman Jones and Peter Petrie took a deserved wicket. Tim then made it three wickets in as many overs and this left Ley Hill at 73-6 and any result possible (including a draw with the clouds closing in.) Petrie then took the prize wicket of Ley Hill number 9 Walter who was looking very comfortable at the crease before a ball that nobody saw came down from the night sky and clattered into the stumps## although Petrie deserved his bit of luck with a number of balls that he bowled going past the edge of the Ley Hill bats. Webster then returned to the attack to finish the innings to finish with impressive figures of 3-20. Ballinger fielded very impressively taking no fewer than 6 catches and not one going down including Derek Richardss 3 catches and Tim Rixs stunning catch to finish the innings. </P> <P>It was a good## competitive match that was played in the right spirit.</P>,,2010-05-04
606,The first match of the season was the first round of the cup and took place on a very chilly and damp Sunday morning. Ballinger batted first and put on an impressive score of 134-5 thanks to some very good batting including two batsmen retiring after reaching 30  Max and Ben Dugdale. &nbsp;Josh Richardson played a very good knock to add useful runs towards the end finishing 20 not out.&nbsp; Hawridge and Cholesbury failed to get any real momentum in the face of some good bowling although one of their batsmen knocked a rapid 30 with some hard hitting including a huge six that landed on the nets. Also they were several players short and were bowled out for 54. Ben Maxdale took three wickets partly thanks to two stumpings by his brother. Dominic Roberts finished the opposition off with a first ball wicket and Ballinger won by a resounding 80 runs.<br>,,2010-05-09
632,<p>On a cold overcast day## Skipper Salisbury lost the toss (no surprise there) maintaining a Ballinger tradition. We also managed to maintain another tradition against Taplow## being 1 short of players. When we phoned up Rollo## we found that he was at Luton catching a plane a day early. After 6 overs we managed to get Tim Cutter on to field who threw himself about in the outfield preventing many runs. Thanks Tim. In the first over we managed to get a very early wicket with an unusual shot offered from the Taplow opener## the shot would probably have been better suited to a New York Yankees V Boston Redsox baseball match## the batsman was bowled much to the amusement of the fielders. This bought N.Mohammed to the crease## a tall sri-lankan overseas batsman who stroked the ball around nicely## taking advantage of the usual inconsistent Ballinger bowling attack. When Fally struck (Yes we were desperate) with a good ball which got the other opener Lbw## we looked in the game. This was not the case as the other Sri-Lankan overseas player Sujith came in## and proceeded to milk our bowling attack round the park . The pair put 85 on in 11 overs before Sujith fell after being given Lbw to Paul. The rest of the Taplow line up showed little depth or skill and when N.Mohammed fell for a very well played 89## they collapsed due to some great bowling by Jake Cutter and Jack Hankinson who was the pick of the bowlers. Both bowlers got 3 wickets. Credit to Paul Humphries who bowled a long 14 over stint and got 3 wickets: namely the two Sri-Lankans. We ended up doing well and restricting Taplow to 209 in 43 overs. One thing that was a little worrying was the extra count of 34 with 19 wides.</p> <p>After a very nice tea## Ballinger set out slowly. Paul Humphries fell for a promising 16 attempting to hit the ball into the stratosphere . Will smith followed soon after## bowled by a good ball hitting the top of the off stump. At 28-2 Ballinger looked in a slump but a well crafted 31 from Joe Hankinson including a few extravagant shots## provided some relief. Fally looked out-of-sorts to start with but by the end of his 15 runs he was starting to look more fluent## he was bowled. Ballinger lost wickets at a constant rate and Max Dugdale volunteered for fee collection when he was out first ball. Tim Cutter## Ballinger&rsquo;s overseas player who came out of retirement for this game followed soon after. Skipper Salisbury saved some embarrassment with a well played 24 batting at number 10 but when he was out Ballinger soon collapsed. We finished on 121 for 10 in 41 overs.</p> <p>It was a good and competitive match## in which we deserved to come second. I would like to thank our host Taplow for an excellent tea and a lovely place to play cricket. The way we restricted Taplow to 209 was commendable as in the 31st over with both sri-lankans going well it could have got messy. Joe&rsquo;s batting was also very promising and he played some wonderful shots. In future we need to bowl more accurately first up## and bat more sensibly and in partnerships.</p>,,2010-05-10
671,League Div. 3<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Thanks to Nigel by 1.30pm we had eleven players on the team sheet## quite a feat. Sadly we had no Nigel thanks to the attractiveness of his 50 last week to the first team and## after stand in skipper Rix lost the toss and Ballinger took to the field we had only nine. The two missing players were found a few doors down the road## one finishing his lunch and the other contemplating in the smallest room!<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The age range of the BWCC team set a new record with no one between the ages of 17 &amp; 47 playing.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Haddenham got off to a careful start against a really good opening spell from both Evan Webster and Hamish Sim with Hamish taking the first wicket. The remaining opener and the Haddenham number 3 McCarron then put together an intelligent partnership which went on and on and on. Bowlers came and bowlers went for reasons of permitted spell length and inability to bowl more than one good ball every two or three. The weather certainly did not help with reported sightings of Ranolph Fiennes and brass monkeys locally. Spinners hands were cold and with 4 all keen to have a go the score mounted relentlessly. A brief flurry of wickets came as a result of the re-introduction of Hamish and when McCarron posted his debut ton Haddenham declared after 44 overs with a demanding 262-6. Was his declaration late because he was fearful of the Ballinger youth and experience?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The star of the Ballinger bowling attack was undoubtedly Hamish## who with 3-16 in his 8 permitted overs bowled straight and with a little zip in all the right areas. Great stuff.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The best bit of the day however was tea. Many thanks to Veronica for what was universally hailed as the best tea for a long while. Never have we seen so much tea being drunk and cradled between numb hands. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>However## eventually from the warm pavilion were prised Derek and Kim Hughes to unleash hell on the Haddenham attack at a required run rate of 6.4. The unleashing of hell came slowly## shortly after it had frozen over in fact. Statement retracted! Skipper Rix had in fact instructed the openers to prize their wickets and protect the kids (still thawing in the pavilion## now with the door shut to preserve its thermal properties whilst Veronica dispensed more hot tea and doughnuts).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Their partnership grew and indeed flourished until Kim perished with the score on 90 after what had seemed longer than the timeless test of 1896 between Gents &amp; Players but had in fact only been 28 overs. Enter young Monty Thompson## promoted to 3 based on incessant nagging and pleading for a bat. Not only young but diminutive too  however not short of confidence..With the Haddenham fielders closing in and smelling fresh meat young Monty soon had them ducking and diving for cover as he played a series of hard hit pulls and drives. Derek## encouraged by Monty to Run! Run! Run! had little option than join in with Derek playing a range of lovely well timed cuts and pushes. Soon the bonus points started to arrive and with the batsmen in no trouble at all the thought was## what if we had really gone for the win from the start? The answer of course was that we would have been 80-7 with the boys having to hang on for 25 overs!<BR>&nbsp;<BR>28 overs soon became 41 and with the total on 159-1 the very last ball of the match saw Monty castled for a very creditable 25 whilst Derek carried his bat for an assured and very impressive 75 not out.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Ok## it was a losing draw but our target was way too high and with Derek and Kim doing exactly the right thing we could reflect on a match where we played to our strengths and were certainly not humiliated despite fielding 8 boys (7 aged 14 or under) against a team mainly made up of men.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Well played lads and I hope that you have thawed out by now!,,2010-05-11
631,<p>Mid Bucks League</p> <p>Lowering grey clouds## biting north wind with a hint of drizzle. Given a choice of places to be## and things to be enjoying## cricket at Holmer Green is probably not high on anyone&rsquo;s list. The forecast was that the drizzle would intensify## so no surprise then that Holmer Green asked Ballinger to bat first. Not a very promising start## either. Matt Riley went early## then a watchful Paul Humphreys was undone by an athletic caught and bowled effort. Things looked bad## especially as BWCC were seriously short of regulars## with four second-teamers called up into the side.</p> <p>However## a spirited stand of 79 between Richard O&rsquo;Kelly and Ian Davies took the score up to 109 in the 33rd over## before Davies was suckered by the first ball from a new bowler. Thereafter wickets fell rapidly## but O&rsquo;Kelly took control at the other end## and with a mixture of watchful defiance and splendid aggression took his score to an unbeaten 90 before the overs ran out## by which time Ballinger had a respectable 170 for 8 on the board.</p> <p>It drizzled during the tea break## but not enough to delay a resumption. BWCC opened with Nick Adams and Paul Humphreys. Nick soon struck## taking 2 &ndash; 14 in an economical 9 overs. Paul## charging through his 12 overs off a two pace run up## also got an early wicket## the HG skipper deftly pouched by keeper O&rsquo;Kelly## standing up. A hard-hitting stand of 48 for the 4th wicket threatened Ballinger&rsquo;s progress## with Andy Thompson&rsquo;s figures taking a beating. However## he had the last laugh## bowling both the batsmen involved## to finish with 3 -46## and Ian Davies chipped in with a couple of late wickets as HG were dismissed in the 32nd over for 116## and all involved&nbsp; made haste for some welcome hot showers.</p> <p>After last week&rsquo;s disappointing show## a very welcome victory.

607,The U13s first league match was against Chesham on a freezing evening. The opposition batted first and several of their county players scored heavily on the small ground at Chartridge. Ballingers bowling was erratic although the opening pair of Will Reid and Hamish Sim both bowled well and tied Chesham down at the start. In fact Hamish was the most economical of the bowlers conceding just 18 runs off 4 overs. Kenny Holt and Josh also succeeded in slowing the run rate by taking pace off the ball later in the innings. Josh bowled an amazing over&nbsp; (19th) with a catch## stumping and run out## including the wickets of some class mates (always fun).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Ballingers innings started well with Max Dugdale and Bob McPherson (who top scored with 20)&nbsp; defending against some fierce and fast bowling.

Also a first correct call of the coin by skipper Riley## who took one look at a perfect batting track and opted for first knock on it. There followed a very encouraging opening stand## which had yielded 89 before Riley fell for 34 in the 24th over. Until then the Aylesbury bowlers had never looked very menacing## but nor could the Ballinger batsmen really dominate## and it was evident quite early on that they would need a total of well over 200 on this pitch to be competitive.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Joined by last week&rsquo;s star## Richard O&rsquo;Kelly## Paul Humphreys upped the pace with 12 fours and a six before departing&nbsp; for a praiseworthy 74## with the score standing at 132## and 33 overs gone.

Evidently deciding that the Gods were on his side## he proceeded to a very rapid 52## and he and O&rsquo;Kelly had transformed Ballinger&rsquo;s position by the time Richard was out for 31## with the total 213 in the 41st over. Wickets fell in the inevitable last overs scramble## and the final score of 231 for 6 after 45 looked just about right.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Aylesbury opened with a veritable blast of big hitting## and opening bowlers Jack Maciver and Tom Graham were unable to find consistent line or direction &ndash; 7 wides between them. However## Aylesbury paid a price for their aggression.

Loss of the toss## and fielding first on a warm sunny afternoon (yes## warm and sunny !!) ## once again shorn of a number of 1st team regulars## and facing our regular Downley nemesis J Cox## all added up to a daunting prospect for the afternoon. And so it proved. The aforesaid Mr Cox ## with his father partnering him## batted remorselessly. Taking no risks against bowling that whilst steady could find no life in the pitch## they just went on and on## and on. Drinks breaks came and went## but they didn&rsquo;t## until when least expected## Cox (snr) missed one from Ian Davies. By this time the partnership was worth 196 with only 36 overs gone. Cox(jnr)&nbsp; went two overs later## again to Davies## for an impressive 124## and there was talk in the Downley dressing room of a declaration at 43 overs. But the anticipated run-fest in the last 8 overs didn&rsquo;t really happen## to the bowlers&rsquo; credit## and so Downley opted to bat for their full 45 overs.&nbsp; Mistake?</p> <p>254 looked a tall order but by no means impossible if Ballinger could get off to a good start. Which indeed they did## with Matt Riley and Paul Humphreys scoring at nearly 5 an over. Then Riley## surprisingly## was castled## and Humphreys started to make batting look difficult against the outswing of R Ali. When he fell for a creditable 33 the score stood at 76 (18 overs gone)## and with the Ballinger middle order looking very shaky indeed## wickets tumbled. Thoughts now turned to saving the game. Fally was joined by Jamie Kellock## and the rearguard action started. Runs became irrelevant## wickets vital. Fally perished## but Andy Thompson and Joe Hankinson both gave valuable support to the limpet-like Kellock. Ever more frantic bowling changes by Downley proved fruitless## and when the 45 overs were up## a beaming Jamie had survived 63 balls for a score of 7## and caused much gnashing of Downley teeth## exacerbated by the fact that they had managed to drop him off a sitter. Top scorer for Ballinger was Extras (42). Says it all## really!</p> <p>This was a classic illustration of the damage that could be done to the game## should the MBL ever adopt the &ldquo;win/lose&rdquo; format.

Having been looking in fine fettle he played and missed at a couple of long hops which took so long to arrive he almost hit them the second time round. Finally he managed to hit one## unfortunately this was the one that kept low and hit the very bottom of Robs bat and then slowly trickled back onto the stumps with just enough energy to remove the bails.</P> <P>Bastie and Derek added 23 for the 3rd wicket before Bastie fell to another long-hop.

Unfortunately at this point drinks were taken. Normally this dictates that the batting side will collapse## any established partnership will be broken etc. How come BWCC's junior bowlers didn't see it like this. Instead they then decided that another 17 overs in the field at the hottest part of the day was just what we all needed. Long hops## full tosses## legside and off side they didn't care. Suddenly the POB 8th wicket pair have taken the score to 164. It needed a bit of slow lobbers from the skipper and line and length from U12 Hamish Sim to retrieve the situation.</P> <P>In fairness it did get very hot and skipper Kerry&nbsp;should have used his bowlers more effieciently.&nbsp;Evan Webster bowled very well in his first spell and new boy Will Reid took his first senior wicket but after a loose first over Peter Petrie showed them how to do it with 3-18 in 6 overs. Hamish Sim did no more than was expected of him by taking 2-24. </P> <P>Having been given an uneccessary steep target Ian hardy and Will Smith set about the job with complete confidence and were happily scoring at the required 3.5 an over. Then both fell within 2 overs and suddenly we were under a bit of pressure.Ian tried to play 'French cricket' and will thought he'd become a coach so gave some catching ptractice.</P> <P>The bowling was either very good or complete rubbish and that made batting more difficult. Will Rawlinson was out to a ball the bounced twice then he hit it in the air to a fielder. Bastie did something similar. Paul Branigan and Peter were looking perfectly happy## if a bit frustrated they couldn't scotre at more than the 3or 4 an over that was needed. Paul decided to hit out or get out- well we all know where that leads## Evan didn't bother to watch the ball and the skipper needed not only the different glasses he summoned from the side lines but a new bat## pads## and brain. Fortunately Rob Rose was on hand to help Peter guide the Waggoners home.</P> <P>A long afternoon in the sun## a very enjoyable result and a very pleasant bunch of blokes they were in the pub. </P> <P><BR>&nbsp;</P>,,2010-05-26
608,<P>BWCC U13s v The Lee U13s 19th May League</P> <P>BWCC 124 -4 The Lee 119 - 6</P> <P>Ballinger hosted local rivals The Lee on Wednesday evening. It was a beautiful evening and everyone was looking forward to a good match. The spectators weren't to be dissapointed. </P> <P>Ballinger batted first and got off to a dreadful start when Rob McPherson was run out in the first over without facing a ball.Hamish Sim then joined Max Dugdale and by dint of some judicious shot selction## good running between the wickest and some luck they put on 65 before Max had to retire. Hamish continued the good work before being caught for a well deserved 27. Ben Dugdale and Josh Richardson then added 20 for the 4th wicket with Ben steering the Waggoners to a par score of 124.</P> <P>The Lee bowled and fielded well on a fast outfield.</P> <P>Guss Knott and George Louch opened for The Lee. Gus looking in fine form but George was quickly removed by a fine bit of fielding.Hamish was on top form keeping the batters under the cosh conceding only 18 in his 4 overs and also taking the important wicket of Lee skipper Will Young. Gus finally had to retire on 30 and it was left to Fraser Percival and Dalton to take the attack to Ballinger. Neither looked in any trouble until the introduction of kenny Holt. Dalton was dropped off his 1st ball and then he bowled Fraser in his 2nd over.The thrash was on now as overs were running out but the score was mounting. Dalton was keeping his cool until finally being stumped trying to hit Ben Dugdale out of the ground. 19 were now needed off the last 2 overs. Ben took the peunultimate over and his gamble to take the pace off the ball worked well with only 4 being scored. 15 off the last over and Hamish to bowl it.Single off the 1st ball## then another##then he fired one down the leg side and it looked like 4 runs all the way until Kenny launched himself at the ball and stopped it somehow. A brillaint bit of fielding.Dot ball then another down the legside went straight for 4 byes.Another 4 and the game would have swung in The Lee's favour but Hamish held his nerve and allowed another single then a scampered 2 off the last ball meant The Lee finished 5 short.</P> <P>A very exciting finish## a very enjoyable game played in exactly the right spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P>.</P>,,2010-05-27
609,<P>U13 v Ley Hill## League## Away</P> <P><BR>The U13s went to Ley Hill on Sunday 22nd May## a scorching morning in the middle of the unexpected heatwave. We batted first and many batsmen got a start without going on to make a big score. Ley Hills fielding made runs hard to come by and included some very good catches. Max (15)## Freddie (14) and Hamish (11) were the top scorers## while Joe## Ollie and Kenny all contributed a few useful runs. Ballingers total of 91 off the full 20 overs looked light at the innings break.</P> <P>After losing an early wicket## Ley Hill got into a strong position reaching 44-1 after six overs&nbsp; with a good 40 run second wicket partnership. With the bowlers wilting in the heat## Ben turned to his spinners## i.e. himself (2 for 11)## Kenny (1 for 9) and Monty (2 for 9) who broke the partnership and cut through the middle order. Hamish also bowled beautifully picking up three wickets## all bowled (with figures of&nbsp; 3  20). </P> <P>Max took two sharp stumpings and two run outs## one from a great throw by Dom. Even so## with 12 needed and three wickets left## Ley Hill still seemed to have the upper hand with five overs left. But the pressure was too much for the tail enders against Ballingers excellent tight bowling and fielding. </P> <P>Freddie D-S came back to bowl the 19th over with the opposition needing 5 to win. Four dot-balls## a no ball and then a mix up between the batsmen as they desperately tried to score which led to a run out off the last ball with Ley Hill on 89. Ballinger had won by two runs## the second nail biter the team won in a week! <BR>BWCC 91 all out (20 overs)<BR>Ley Hill 89 all out (19 overs)<BR></P>,,2010-05-28
636,<p>After a wonderful tea## cheers Graham## he really was man of the moment## Ballinger faced the gruelling prospect of fielding in the 28* Heat. Bourne End came at us like an express train with their opener taking Jack Hankinson for quite a few runs of his first over. Jack Hankinson had the last laugh when he got him for a brisk 26. Meanwhile the other opener had fallen to the wily and experienced Phil Lloyd. Phil continued to take wickets quickly. After a moment of genius from yours truly## diving after the ball## getting to my knees and hurling the stumps down from point (Paul Collingwood eat your heart out) Bourne End offered little resistance. They ended up limping to 88 for 10 despite &lsquo;Georgies&rsquo; best efforts (The mid on fielder I was talking about earlier). Pick of the bowlers was Phil who got 3 for 31. Stu McGowan bowled very well considering it was his first match back for 5 years and he got 2 for 10 from his 5 overs. The honours were left to Joe Hankinson who knocked their number 11 over and sealed a well deserved 132 run victory</p> <p>The match will be remembered for Slaughter of the Lambs-gate (SOTLG) Graham winning a toss and getting a few runs and Xavier&rsquo;s classy batting. Drinks at the Swan were nice and the Ballinger Sunday&rsquo;s Juggernaut keeps matching on</p>,,2010-05-28
617,<P>Chalfont St.Peter 110-10 BWCC 112 - 1</P> <P>For the second time in a week## an unbeaten partnership from Hankinson and Bartlett saw Ballinger U15's home## as they romped to a 9 wicket victory over Chalfont St Peter. </P> <P>Bowling first a nine man Ballinger side endeavoured to plug the gaps in the field and keep the Chalfont run rate down. The opening bowling of Webster and Hankinson put Chalfont under pressure from the off inducing the suicidal run-out of Foskett (1) for the breakthrough in the fifth over. When Keen lost his middle stump to the wild inswing of Webster in the following over Ballinger looked set to restrict Chalfont to a managable total. The home side battled back however. A mixture of loose bowling and enterprising batting from Knibb (24) and Allen (29) contributed to Chalfont racking up some much needed runs. </P> <P>The inspired introduction of wicket-keeper come offspinner Bartlett put the brakes on the Chalfont charge. His mixture of unrelenting accuracy with a hint of turn helped him to tidy figures of 4 for 12 from his 4 over spell. By the time Ben Dugdale had wrapped up the innings with consecutive wickets the host's final total of 110 seemed a manageable target with some sensible batting. </P> <P>Smith and Bartlett looked set to put Ballinger on course for victory## seeing off the opening five overs for 30 runs with both batsmen poaching boundaries from the odd loose deliveries. When Smith (13) chipped a slower one from Silman to midwicket however## the game was poised at a crucial stage. the short-numbered visitors requiring another 80 whilst effectively three down. Enter Hankinson to once again to partner Bartlett in blasting through the opposition attack. Hankinson's innings of 47 n.o. only ever seemed in threat when a brutal pull was commendably held at bckward square leg## only for the clearly wounded feilder to inadvertently teeter over the rope to hand the visitors a six. Bartlett himself glued the innings together with a solid 44 n.o. as Ballinger coasted home with 8 overs remaining.<BR></P>,,2010-05-29
694,<P>High Wycombe U10 v BWCC U10A League 26th May</P> <P>High Wycombe 210 - 14 BWCC 254 - 5</P> <P>For those not familiar with the 'pairs' format of junor cricket the above result looks very odd.<BR>The important thing is the number of wickets lost because the penalty for losing a wicket during a 'Pair's'4 overs is -6 runs.<BR>Therefore if you mulitply Wycombes 14 x 6 = 84 means they actually scored 294 v BWCC's 290.<BR>I say scored## actually they scored 49 off the bat the rest were extras. Most of these were wides or no balls which is far too many to give away.</P> <P>To the game</P> <P>Wycombe won the toss and elected to bat. The Waggoners skipper Freddie Thompson opened with Gus DS and what a selection. A hatrick and a run out gave the Waggoners the ideal start. Freddie then bowled from the other end and started with a 2 wicket maiden. Gus took another wicket in his 2nd over and by then end of the first pairs 4 overs Wycombe were in dissaray at 167. (Each side starts on 200)<BR>Max Leane and hector Gibbs kept up the pressure with Max taking 2 - 6 and Hector only conceding 7 runs.Ollie Hardman and Zac Bischoff carried on the good work with another 2 wickets each. Joe Turrel then bowled 2 overs of high quaility left arm spin taking 1 - 0. Taylor Levitt did his bit as well. Then Wycombe staged a recovery with Liam Morgan scoring 24 and the last 4 overs conceded 28. This took them to 210.</P> <P>Freddie opened with Joe and were soon running frantically between the wickets. All good stuff but the runs off the bat and extras were negated by them losing 2 wickets. The pair added 12 and then Marcus Tingey and Ollie added another 10## Hector and Zac another 7. Then the big stand of 20 between Max and Taylor which took the Waggoners to a postion of safety.Harry and Gus finished off the innings playing careful defence to ensure no wickets were lost.</P> <P>An excellent performance all round with Freddie marshalling the troops with great aplomb.</P>,,2010-05-29
688,The second round of the cup was played at Chenies and Latimer with a new look team as five regulars were away on a school trip. Batting first## Ballinger lost two early wickets against some good opening bowling## but then Max Dugdale and Will Gibbs put on a great 50 run partnership. Max played yet another attacking innings and retired for the third time out of five matches so far. Will took his opportunity to bat higher in the order## scoring a very good 25## with some thumping leg side boundaries. Monty came in at five and upped the tempo## hitting a big six to midwicket that just missed a spectators dog## while scoring 23. Wickets kept falling in the last few overs which pegged Ballinger back a bit. The last ball was crazy as James Rackley took an all run four## pressurising the fielders into multiple overthrows. 116 for 7 looked a parr score## that Ballinger could defend with good bowling and fielding. Ballingers bowling didnt start well and the opening bowlers both had an off day## each starting their overs with a couple of wides. They werent the only bowlers whose radar wasnt working as Ballinger gave away a total 17 wides (and all those extra balls). Fortunately Ben who came on as first change bowler## was on song## and picked up two early wickets in a four over spell with two maidens and taking 2 for 5. Even so Chenies were doing well and looked set to win at 87-2 after 15 overs. But then Monty came on and bowled the 16th over. He steps up with a couple of gentle paces## bowls his slow and accurate spin....one run off the first ball## wicket - caught next## dot (good shout for lbw declined)## another dot## wicket (bowled)## wicket (lbw)!!! Definitely the turning point in the match - the spirit of El Alamein perhaps? Almost everyone got a bowl and George## James## Will and Kenny all took wickets as Chenies crumbled## although a few more wides kept the nerves jangling. Fortunately Ballinger were holding their catches all day long## five in total. Kenny came on for the final over with 13 needed and after a couple of nervous full tosses## he managed to keep it tight. It was too much for Chenies who lost another wicket to a run out and whose last pair could only manage 3 runs. After trying to snatch defeat## Ballinger had finally won by 9 runs  a third final over win in a couple of weeks. But for the wides it wouldnt have been nearly so close. They progress into the cup quarter final. The match was played in a very good spirit and was enjoyed by everyone involved and all the spectators.

695,<P>&nbsp;</P> <P><BR>Result BWCC won by 66 Runs<BR>BWCC&nbsp; 267-7&nbsp; Dinton CC 201-9</P> <P>Harry Livingstone won the toss on a pleasant morning at the attractive Dinton Cricket ground and elected to bat. Some rash shots and risky running between the wickets in the early overs put BWCC in a&nbsp; precarious position. However## powerful hitting by Zak and Hector steadied the ship and put BWCC on top. Monty Weatherall batted very sensibly picking up quick## but safe## singles off most deliveries he faced. Harry L and George Cook scored 17 off the last four overs to give BWCC a respectable 267. The loss of 7 wickets was a little disappointing## that&nbsp; said##&nbsp; Dinton had some very decent bowlers and the boys did well to keep out their best bowler&nbsp; who only took one wicket from 3 overs.</P> <P>It was now BWCCs turn&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; field. The opening overs by Taylor and George Cook were tight. The highlight however was two outstanding pieces of fielding by Zak and George who both had direct hits to secure run outs. This put Dinton on the back foot and&nbsp; after 4 overs they were on 187. George Cook bowled an excellent line with good pace. In all BWCC took&nbsp; 9 wickets which was a tribute to the accuracy of the bowling of the entire team. The left arm spin of Joe and Harry was excellent. Hugo## bowling right arm round the wicket## was accurate and picked up a wicket. William bowled a variable line## but when on target was too good for the opposition and bowled out two of the Dinton players.&nbsp; I particularly enjoyed watching Montys leg spin## which left the opposition mystified as to what was going on. After 20 overs Dinton were 201## a victory by 66 runs</P> <P>A word about the fielding. It was excellent. Catches were taken## half chances attempted  if not&nbsp; taken## and a number of run outs as mentioned above. Marcus leapt backwards to take a great catch&nbsp; whilst keeping wicket. The boys were also impeccably behaved on and off the field. Well done.</P> <P>Paul Rose 2/6/10<BR></P>,,2010-06-02
601,<P>Two of our players had to drop out at the last minute## which was probably the difference between the two sides.&nbsp; Whilst## the Ballinger batting performance to put on 98 in 20 overs was a reasonable target to defend## the opposition scraped home with a ball to spare.&nbsp; Ballinger's batting depth helped.&nbsp; Although we lost 7 wickets## in each case## this was down to the batsmen unselfishly trying to force the pace.&nbsp; Kingshill fielded very well## taking 5 catches including two which would have impressed Collingwood.&nbsp; James Mc (12)## Hamish (16)## Dom (16)## Will G(14) and Freddie T(12) all made useful double figure contributions - in particular Dom changed the pace of the run rate by scoring his equal top score of 16 off just 9 balls.</P> <P>Having taken 6 catches and dropped none against Wendover## we let ourselves down by doing exactly the opposite## dropping 6 and catching none.&nbsp; Just one of those catches would have delivered a victory.&nbsp; The two Thompsons bowling 4 overs back to back each in the middle slowed down the run rate but it was Dom Brown's crucially tight spell at the end which gave ballinger the scent of victory..not to be as the Kingshill 5 was able to get bat on ball against Hamish in the last over and found the boundary. To be fair## most of the catches did not go to hand.&nbsp; Man of the match was awarded to Dom Brown.</P> <P>It was an exciting finish and despondend U12 team## who could not quite contain the opposition.</P>,,2010-06-08
602,<P>Ballinger were thrashed with some very good batting by the Chesham top order including our ex teamsman## Theo Reynolds who scored 29.&nbsp; A significant contribution to this one sided result was the weather; by the time Ballinger took to the field## it was non stop raining and none of the usually tight Ballinger bowlers were able to control the ball or their feet.&nbsp; Ballinger had to give up the considerable advantage of fielding first because of the late arrival of 3 of their team members.&nbsp; The batting started well with Freddie (17) and Brandon (13) steering Ballinger to 50 for 2 off the first 10 overs.&nbsp; With so many wickets in hand## a 120 looked feasible. However in attempting to force the pace## both gave away their wickets and a middle order collapse followed with S Rance taking 3 wickets for 6 runs of 4 overs.&nbsp; </P> <P>Thanks to late flourishes by Oscar## tops scoring on 19## Ballinger posted what seemed to be a defendable 93 runs.&nbsp; Given that Chesham had only managed 87 (we had scored 98) off their 20 overs against Kingshill## we had hopes of containing them.&nbsp; However with 17 off the first 2 overs## Chesham quickly quashed any hope overhauling their target in just 10 overs.&nbsp; Our usually tight openners had no grip whatsoever which left our pace man## Hamish bowling off a 4 pace run-up and Will Gibbs being given a rare opportunity to prove to his coach that he can bowl spin - a first over of 1-1 might have proved a point but 14 of his 3rd suggests that there is some work still to do on this fledgling talent!&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the conditions## the fielders all put their bodies on the line with William Arnold and James Mc both nursing bruises but stopping runs.</P> <P>My man of the match goes to Oscar## who both top scored but also fielded superbly causing the first wicket with an excellent throw to Brandon.</P>,,2010-06-08
610,<P>On a lovely warm evening our U13s took on Great Kingshill at their Widmer End ground in the league - it was half term and several regulars were away. The oppositions openers and top order batsmen scored heavily at the start of their innings## reaching 73-3 in the 13th over. It was a difficult track to get used to bowling on with a tricky slope making it difficult for many bowlers to find a good length and very short boundaries on one side. The fielding was also poor which didnt help the cause. Ballingers attack fought back in the latter part of the innings with Hamish Sim## Ben Dugdale## Will Gibbs and Dom Brown being the pick of the bowlers. The umpire (Bill) took a painful blow from a forceful shot at square leg## inadvertently blocking another boundary. Another incident was a hit wicket off a very wide ball with the umpires having to double-check whether the batsmen could be out - he could. Kingshill finished on 110-8## a good total## but which shouldnt be out of reach as Ballinger had passed 100 in three previous innings.</P> <P>Ballingers reply started badly with the seasons top scorer## Max bowled in the first over. Hamish and Rob settled down and laid a foundation talking the score to 30 before they lost their wickets in quick succession. These two and Ben who was the highest scorer with 17## got a start but none went on to a big score and wickets fell rapidly from then on through the innings. The home team had two leg spinners who were very effective and extracted considerable turn from the pitch## bamboozling some of the batsmen. They also fielded well and held some excellent catches. But our batting wasnt good enough and after losing the last 6 wickets for 30 runs## Ballinger were all out for 75 in the 16th over## losing by 35 runs.</P> <P>Bill Senior</P>,,2010-06-10

The gap between the sides last season was narrow. This year it looks rather wider !</P> <P>Another lost toss saw Ballingers openers fending off some lively bowling## but all went well until deafness (or was it mute-ness?) resulted in the farcical running out of Matt Riley## who had looked in prime form. Rollo came## and went## but Ian Davies joined Paul Humphreys## and they took the score to 104 by the 29th over## even though they were never able to dominate the bowlers## on a lively pitch.The loss of Ian for 38 to a blinding catch## followed quickly by Paul for a very patient 42 led to a rapid clatter of wickets## with only Jack Maciver standing firm (32 not out). A few lusty blows by Nick Adams saw BWCC reach 168 for 8 wickets at 45 overs  a total well short of par## one thought.</P> <P>And so it proved.&nbsp; Knotty Greens batsmen started pasting some unimpressive looking Ballinger bowling to all parts## and continued in that vein. A brilliant catch off a skyer by Fergus Hardy gave Adams a wicket with total on 58## but skipper Rileys bowling changes went unrewarded until he brought on Jack Hankinson in the 21st over## with Paul Humphreys at the other end. Suddenly batting became difficult## and three wickets fell## all to the impressive Jack Hankinson## who finished with 3  22 off 5.1 overs. But it was too late.

His choice was clouded by the fact that he actually had a decent batting side. </P> <P><BR>As usual he chose caution and after 15 overs it looked like his decison was going to work. Evan Webster and Phil LLoyd both bowled really tight opening spells keeping The Lee openers down to 3 an over which is good going on this ground.When Evan finished Kerry turned to Carlton Siddle playing his first league game for the club and his battle with Lee opener England was worth the admission fee with Carlton finally winning the battle. In the mean time Tom McIntyre had been weaving his magic at the other end and thanks to a brilliant stumping by Jeremy Hunting and an easy catch by the skipper took&nbsp; 2- 52 in his 10 overs.</P> <P><BR>Jake Cutter had a brief foray into the attack but by the time he came on Lee top scorer Susman was into his stride and anything short was despatched.Evan was returned to the attack and quickly restored order by first bowling Susman and then having Lapham elastically caught by Jeremy. He finished with an excellent ct &amp; bld. 10 - 3 - 25 -3 are pretty good figures in any company.</P> <P>The Lee declared after only 40 overs on 212 - 6 which looked very sporting on a decent track.</P> <P>Bastie Richards and Ian Hardy opened up for the Waggoners but Ian set himself up to collect he money when he was out to his first ball. Tim Rix replaced him and looked like a man wanting to make sure he didn't miss the start of another match being played on a different continent.<BR>When he was out Carlton continued with the bat where he'd left off with the ball. His full range of shots soon had the Waggoners back up with the run rate but following a camoe from Tom McIntyre it was a Hunting/LLoyd partnership that looked like turning the game in Ballingers favour. 60 in 8 overs what was just what the visitors needed and a win looked on the cards. Unfortunately the Geoff Boycott philosphy of 'add 2 wickets and then see how it looks' became apparent when Jeremy and Phil were out within a couple of overs of each other and the skipper was left with the tail.</P> <P>&nbsp;Keep going or play for the draw was the question and with the demise of Jake Cutter he decided to shut up shop. Unfortunately a long hop was too difficult to refuse so he pulled gently to mid on. 12 year old Oliver Cooksey playing his first game for the adults managed a single off his second ball before Evan was caught off a skier to bring proceedings to a close.</P> <P>A lovely day## a really enjoyable game game even if it was the wrong result##a bit of bite between a couple of senior pros## a fantastic bit of fielding from Harry Rice of The Lee## and a wonderful tea.<BR>&nbsp;</P> <P><BR>&nbsp;<BR></P>,,2010-06-13

603,"<p>Ballinger beat Chenies by 60 runs</p> <p>Following our performances against Kingshill and Chesham## Ballinger needed a victory to avoid being in the relegation zone of the league. Whilst there was never much doubt of securing a victory## like at Chesham## a good run rate in the first 10 overs with 79 for the loss of 3 wickets was not matched in the second 10## where we gave away 7 wickets for just 33 runs.</p> <p>Credit to Chenies who raised their game and fielded with aplomb## taking 4 catches and stopping some hard drives and hooks. Freddie looked very settled on 17## holding up one end of the wicket until## like almost all the batsmen## he had a rush of blood to the head## charged up the wicket and was clean bowled by fellow school-mate## Will Rance## who delighted in the fact that he managed to have a hand in getting out both his Beacon mates## having caught Monty in the preceding over. Monty's rapid 15 helped keep the score ticking over but it was Oscar## who had been advanced up the order on the back of his Chesham performance## who delivered and retired on around the 12th over for 31. Dom Brown## coming in at 5 delivered a typical Dom Brown performance - a couple of boundaries and then caught for 12. Ballinger finished on 112 with most of the batsman having given their wicket away## playing across straight balls or attempting to drive good length balls. Forward and backwards defense will be the strokes## we will be focusing on for the rest of the season! If I was disappointed with the batting##</p> <p>I was conversely delighted with the bowling and fielding. Everyone played their part with catches being taken by Monty## Matt## Brandon## Will and James Mc. Will Arnold bowled out one of the openners with a very good spell of 1-5 off two overs. Monty got revenge on Will Rance## by running him out when he was ambling back to the crease in the mistaken belief that he had scored a 4 (inevitably Will expressed his disappointment - I was very impressed that after the game## he came up and apologised - a good example to all our players). However## the match winner for Ballinger was undoubtedly Will Gibbs. Chenies were on 21 for 2 of the first 5 overs and Will really secured victory for Ballinger in one over by taking a triple wicket maiden. It was a remarkable display of accurate good length bowling## angled into the batsmen.</p> <p>With Will on 4 wickets## the skipper## Monty T## elected to give him a 4th over; at least two very difficult catching opportunities were put down and with one ball to spare## Will came steaming in and bowled probably his best ball of the day## hitting off stump and securing a rare ""Five-for""## with figures of 5-10 over 4 overs. James Mayo also bowled his left arm spin tightly and secured two wickets## including a good stumping by the ever threatening Brandon## who only let through one bye all day (and only his 4th this season## which included a very wet day at Chesham!). Monty T had an opportunity at the helm and whilst there is some work to do with respect to setting and adjusting sensible targets for the batsmen## the leadership in the field was excellent## with some very tactical and sensible field placing and a mature approach to bowler selection.

The highlight of the innings being Monty Thompson`s 30 retired.</p> <p>Our bowlers steadily took wickets despite a pair of very generous umpires## (one of which was me!) until the final batsman fell to Dan Adams` yorker for his second wicket. Ley Hill were all out for 31 in 13 overs due to some superb tight fielding from our lads. JG</p>,,2010-06-15

They batted very well against some mixed Ballinger bowling and fielding with three of the batsmen having to retire with 30 or more. Several of our bowlers struggled to find a good length although Ben and Will Gibbs were pretty economical as ever. Josh turned out to be the pick of the bowlers used##<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>taking two wickets - both bowled - for four runs in his one over with his dibbly dobblies &ndash; straight and on a good length. Unfortunately he was the 9<sup>th</sup> bowler used and only came on in the 19<sup>th</sup> over as he hasn&rsquo;t been in the front line attack up until now. He also made a great run out from square leg. Unfortunately some of Ballinger&rsquo;s fielding was poor## with a few mis-fields## overthrows and several possible catches going down. The total to chase was 156## challenging but perhaps achievable.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;"">By the time our boys batted the sun had <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>dropped down and was straight into the batsmen&rsquo;s eyes at the western end. This made batting very difficult## especially against Heaney## the opening bowler who bowled fast and straight## taking two consecutive wickets in his third over which left us reeling at 13-2 in the fifth over. Max survived the opening spell and batted superbly to top score once again and retire on 30. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Brimming with confidence## Josh played a really good innings (24). Along with Ben and Will Reid Ballinger staged a fight back to 113-4 in the 16<sup>th</sup> over. Although there was a glimmer of a chance## the rate required was too much as the opening bowler came back on and we lost wickets quickly in the run chase. Although it was one of the highest scores this season## 127-8 wasn&rsquo;t enough and we lost by 29 runs. It was an enjoyable game played with great enthusiasm by both sides and in good spirit.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;"">Bill Senior</span></p>",,2010-06-18
675,<p>Ballinger 2nds gave a hardworking performance against a more experienced Prestwood side but were unable to close out an exciting match## which was played in an extremely sporting manner.</p> <p>Ballinger batting first## once stand in captain Richards&nbsp;had made his one significant contribution to the day&nbsp;and lost the toss. A fine opening partnership from Will Smith and Ian Hardy set the base for a useful first innings score. Highlights## followng the&nbsp;opening partnership##&nbsp;included the second wicket partnership between Will Smith and Joe Hankinson.</p> <p>Joe made a quick 28 and Will provided the backbone for the innings in making a mature 54. The stage was set for a blazing performance from Rob McIntyre who contributed 630 not out## ably supported by Kim Hughes and Peter Petrie## which carried ballinger 2nds to a score of 200 for 7 wickets off 45 overs.</p> <p>An excellent teafollowed## provided by Veronica## and ballinger 2nds entered the field## suitably replenished. Oh what joy followed as the first three Prestwood batsmen were each dismissed for nought. Excellent bowling from Evan Webster with 1-36 and Joe hankinson with 1-24. Surely victory would follow but Prestwood fought back with a fine 55 from L. Capeling and 89 not out from N. Heasey.</p> <p>Tom McIntyre tied down the batsmen bowling superbly for 11 overs with figures of 1-53 which did reflect how well he bowled as the ball beat the bat on a number of occasions. It was Tom however who removed L. Capeling when Will Smith made a superb stumping off a snorting delivery.</p> <p>Robert Rose came into the attack and was immediately successful## two wickets in his first over## surely victory would now follow. Robert's figure were a superb 3-34 off 7 overs.</p> <p>In the end the experience of Prestwood's captain## J. Laxton## with 30 not out saw Prestwood home but Ballinger 2nds fought to the end in a match that could have swung either way.</p>,,2010-06-18
698,"<p><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">A spirited Ballinger effort with bat and ball was not enough to overcome a strong Chesham side who secured a 31 run win on a chilly Sunday morning at Ballinger Common.<br /> Batting first the home side looked to attack early## with topscoring Joe Turrell (22) exploding in the third over## notching 3 consecutive boundaries off the Chesham opener Hamza. Their progress was slowed however by timely wickets## Hamza himself picking up two to limit the opening pair to a still impressive 26. A steady stream of runs followed but a solid bowling performance from the visitors culminating with two wickets in the final two overs left the home side with a total of 261.<br /> The Waggoners## needing a excellent fielding performance to stand a chance of keeping Chesham below the target## started brightly with the ball. George Cooke struck in the second over as the Chesham opening pair struggled to impose their game onto the hosts bowling. Seven wicketless overs followed however and Chesham began to build a healthy total## with the score 249 at the halfway mark. An agile caught and bolwed from Zach Bischoff followed by a double wicket over from Angus Dennison-Smith couldn't halt the visitors momentum and they coasted home with an impressive total of 292 from their 20 overs.&nbsp; <br /></span></span></p>",,2010-06-21

643,<p>Ballinger arrived at bleak## cold## pavilion-less Monks Risborough with yet another weakened side## and could muster only 10 men## until Jon Hankinson (Snr) who had driven Jack to the match## gamely volunteered to make up the numbers## having never previously played the game. Skipper Riley was resting an injury## but stood as umpire (hooray)## thus saving us 3 precious points. Monks opted to bat first## and immediately targetted&nbsp; Jon H with a vicious barrage of shots## bravely and competently fielded.</p> <p>Ballinger's opening bowlers Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson both bowled tidily## as did Carlton Siddle## making his debut for the Saturday 1sts. Monk's batsmen are renowned for their rapid scoring and fast running between the wickets## and although the bowlers kept Ballinger in the hunt with wickets falling steadily## the batsmen kept the scoreboard moving. At 137-8 and 36 overs gone there was hope that Ballinger would only be facing a total of 150ish. However## the tail wagged and Monks had&nbsp;reached 174 in the 43rd over before the final wicket was taken. Nick Adams (2 for 32 off 12 overs) and Ian Maciver (3 - 43) were the most successful of the bowlers.</p> <p>A target of 175 looked attainable## especially with 2 extra overs. Three balls later it looked rather less obtainable with Paul Humphreys gone for a duck. Richard O'Kelly then showed some fine shots before falling victim to an athletic catch## for 24. Thereafter## things went from bad to worse## and J Iqbal (6 - 20) made a serious mess of the middle order## though some would blame umpiring injustice for their downfall. A defiant last-wicket stand of 14 between Hankinsons## father and son## saw Ballinger to one measly batting point - but possibly a precious one come the end of the season.</p>,,2010-06-21
677,<p>Ballinger 2nds had a hard match against Frieth who brought an extremely strong batting line up and made the most of a perfect batting track. Evan Webster and Peter Petrie opened and stuck well to the task.</p> <p>It was the young spinners## Jake Cutter and Tom McIntrye who were able to extract some movement from the pitch and both bowled superbly. Jake returned figures of 4-84 off 11 overs and Tom returned 3-53 off 9&nbsp;overs. Tom Graham supported the young spinners in a fine 6 over spell. However despite the efforts of the bowlers Frieth were able to reach a total of 294 for 8 off 40 overs.</p> <p>Ballinger in reply were never really able to approach the total despite a cultured 40 from Rob McIntyre## well supported by Peter Petrie who fell on 14 when looking to step up the run rate. Tom Graham contributed a lusty 20 but it was left to Tom McIntyre with 13 not out and Jake Cutter with 10 not out to see Ballinger safe. Ballinger eventually finishing on 130 for 8.</p>,,2010-06-21
727,<p>Chenies &amp; Latimer 233 - 11 BWCC 265 - 6</p> <p>It was the longest day and the concern was that it might feel like a long night when one of Ballingers least experienced sides took to the field. Only one of them had played in a hard ball game for the club before</p> <p>On a beautiful evening in the Chilterns##Ballinger won the toss and skipper Ben Westland chose to field. His opening attack of Charlotte Wingrove ( Charlie) and James Arnold set the standards for the rest when they took 4 wickets for just 20 runs. Ben and Will Piper&nbsp;followed with&nbsp;excellent 2 over spells and then James Bunce and Henry King tightened the screw. Connor McAlister and Sam Powell only allowed another 21 runs&nbsp;in their spells and took 2 wickets. Hugo Eaton-Hart and mixture of Henry and James A finished the quota keeping Chenies down to a managable 233.</p> <p>Joe Farrelly had been press-ganged into keeping wicket and he was a natural. Soon shouting at everyone about what to do next - wonderful. The rest of the side fielded really well with special mention of Charlie and Henry.</p> <p>The skipper had spent ages agonising over the batting order to the point that is was all organised and the openers out on the pitch before the manager was able to have a cup of tea - very bad form.</p> <p>Hugo and James B set about their task with great gusto and no little skill. Excellent running between the wickets and some good shots meant they left the side in the black by 14runs. Sam and Will took a very defensive approach and the score was still 212 when they finished. Connor and Charlie took the score along to 223 and then and enterprising stand between Joe and Ben took the game away from Chenies finishing on 260. Blunters James A and Henry then took no chances over the last 4 overs scoring just 12 runs but only losing 1 wicket.</p> <p>A really enjoyable evening and a good experience for all concerned.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2010-06-21
604,<p> <p><strong>Lost by 18 runs.</strong></p> <p>A night of firsts:</p> <ul> <li>The first time I have seen a Ballinger player get 4 wickets in 4 balls</li> <li>The first time the captain entered the field wearing make-up</li> <li>The first time## the captain attempted to abdicate his leadership position half way through the first innings (but was overruled by the coach!)</li> </ul> <p>On paper## this was always going to be a tough match. &nbsp;Gerrards Cross has an impressive line up of County names and it was clear that Ballinger were initially somewhat in awe of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gerrards Cross decided to bat and set off at clip of 7-8 an over.

645,<p>Hot sunshine at Ballinger persuaded Matt Riley to bat first against visitors Ibstone on a good-looking track## even though his batting line-up didn't look the strongest.&nbsp;By the 30th over with 141 on the board without loss## the decision seemed a good one## though it must be said that the master of the dot ball Riley (32 consecutive dot balls in a &nbsp;becalmed period) had only contributed 30 ## when Paul Humphreys## hurtling towards a ton## missed a straight one## and departed for an aggressive 90. Matt## to be fair## then speeded up## but the Ballinger middle-order## under pressure to pile on quick runs## experienced one of their all too familiar collapses## and an innings that really needed to yield a total of 270+ could only manage 239 with 6 wickets down## by which time Matt## striking the ball beautifully towards the end## had reached an undefeated 89.</p> <p>Ibstone## in reply## never looked in the slightest trouble on such an easy wicket and lightning fast outfield. Opener M Nilham struck an imperious 139 not out (haven't Ballinger suffered at the hands of Sri-Lankans somewhere before ? )## well supported by B Mills (60). The total was already 172 before Ballinger took their first (and only !) wicket## courtesy of an (over?) exuberant Ian Davies. Carlton Siddle bowled his full allotment of 12 overs## conceding only 58 runs - good going in the circumstances## and Jack Hankinson as usual bowled tidily but unluckily. Ibstone won in the 42nd over - significantly not a single maiden among them.</p> <p>On the bright side## with the Seconds having to scratch## unable to raise a side## at least we had an umpire## courtesy of Ian Hardy## and the Chairman graced us with his presence## until he became too depressed at the sight of impending defeat (or threats from home ?).</p> <p>Half the season gone - time for a fresh start ???</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2010-06-28

728,<p>In a rapidly re-arranged fixture and with a severly dpleted team Ballinger overcame an inexperienced Ley Hill team last night in a thrilling encounter.</p> <p>BCB U11 Cup</p> <p>BWCC 114 - 3&nbsp; Ley Hill 109 - 7</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Skipper James Mcintyre lost the toss and the Waggoners were asked to bat first. James opened with Fred Sanders. Fred was under strict instructions to bat 'properly' which meant he was very confused and was out in the 2nd over trying not to hit the ball into the next county.</p> <p>James was then joined by Rob Farquhar and with a combination of good running between the wickets some excellent shots and a bit of luck these two added 80 for the 2nd wicket before James had to retire (30*). Will Arnold then ran himself out## Rob had to retire(32*) so it was left to Jamie Kingston## Jack Peck and John Collier to take the Waggoners to their final total of 114. A bit below par given the start given by Rob and James but James Cullen bowled a really tight spell for The Hill at the death.</p> <p>Ley Hill set about their task with great gusto and were soon rattling along at the required rate. Unfortunatley the were also loosing wickets until Asquith and Wallis came together. Asquith used local knowledge to great effect by playing the pull shot to nearly every ball and depositing it onto the golf course. Fortunateley he had to retire(30*). Wallis then carried on with Lee and it looked like a Ley Hill win was on the cards but skipper McIntyre had other ideas and having done a stirling job behind the stumps deceided that he was needed with ball in hand. Fred Sanders took his place and James then bowled 2 overs of high speed accuracy## and with Rob bowling his last for only 4 runs it was down to the last over with 10 required. Gethin Ross was given the reponsibility and having been savaged during his first spell was a bit nervous but he held up well and only concede 5 to leave the Waggoners winners by 5 runs.</p> <p>A really enjoyable evening with&nbsp;the game played in exactly the right spirit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2010-07-02
605,<p> <p>High Wycombe beat Ballinger by 80 runs.</p> <p>Its not often as a coach that you get beaten by 80 runs and come off the pitch feeling very proud of your team. &nbsp;Skipper## Hamish Sim deserves significant praise## leading by example but also with huge encouragement to ensure that the team never dropped their heads and continued to perform right the way through the game. &nbsp; Once again## taking wickets was a key part of that performance. &nbsp;Apart from two difficult chances put down## the catching was once again superb.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hamish led the way with a superb CAB in the first over and went on to bowl the perfect ball## hitting top of off stump to get their dangerous looking number 4. &nbsp;George Ryland bowled as well as I have seen him bowl all season## took two wickets and kept the run rate under control. &nbsp;Seth took two very good catches. &nbsp;Will tried out his spin with some success and took a good catch. &nbsp;Hamish and Dom shared the wicket keeping and managed just 4 byes between them## considerably less than the opposition. Dom was particularly impressive## particularly in dealing with Hamish's fast bowling. &nbsp;At one stage## Wycombe were 90 of 9 overs; they ended up setting us a substantial target of 160 runs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hamish (24) and Dom (30) batted very sensibly. &nbsp;Dom's innings against some of the best bowling in the counry was a lesson to himself in shot selection. The middle order struggled after this## however a final flourish from Henry Turrell and Ollie Cooksey (who each played the two best shots of the day) in the last over meant that we posted a perfectly respectable 81 in reply. &nbsp;</p> <p>My man of the match is Hamish## who led the team very well## took two key wickets## wicket kept and scored a controlled 24</p> </p>,,2010-07-04
679,"<p>Ley Hill 165 - 10 BWCC 166-3</p> <p>When he lost the toss on Saturday and Ley Hill elected to bat## the Waggoners skipper Nigel Kerry## and his team## thought they were in for a long## unpleasant##afternoon in the field &nbsp;but## once the wiles of opening bowler Phil LLoyd and his young pretender Joe Hankinson were on display## the gloom of the day was dispersed to become like the blue sky above.</p> <p>Ley Hill were under the cosh from the first ball as## on a good track and fast outfield## only 23 were score off the first 12 overs## with Phil taking an excellent C &amp; B to remove 1 of the openers and Joe giving the batsmen no room to play any run scoring shots.</p> <p>&nbsp;Ben Carlin took Joe's place and struck immediately. His first ball for a year was a cunningly delivered full toss.This was sent straight up in the air by the Hill's no 3 for Max Dugdale## making his debut as 'keeper## to run to square leg and claim the catch.</p> <p>Phil was then rewarded for his efforts with another wicket before being replaced by Evan Webster(6.0.1.30). At this stage The Hill were stuck at 46 off 17 overs.&nbsp;Ben then took an unbeliveable caught and bowled to reduce Ley Hill to 67-5. The Hill skipper## Dave Peterson## dug in and## with Connolly and then McCarthy## added nearly 50 runs but## by this time Tom McIntyre was weaving his web of leg spin magic.</p> <p>It was difficult to know who was more confused## the batsmen or the close fielders## as Tom was turning the ball so much. After a bit dodgy footwork by the fielders during his first couple of overs## Tom hit the mark and bowled&nbsp;his next seven overs for 21 whilst taking 3 wickets.</p> <p>Ben had by now been replaced by Joe who## once more## gave the skipper a level of control he would only normally dream about. Phil came back to take another wicket and## with Tom## cleaned up a Hill tail which had a wracked up a rapid 20 runs under the guidance of Wilson.</p> <p>It was a good fielding effort by all but should be noted in particular for Max Dugdale making his debut behind the stumps in an adult game. The records are carefully being searched to see if a ""keeper has ever been involved in 5 dismissals before- especially as he did it reasonably quietly. Also Joe's bowling efforts as## at the moment## 0-24 off 12 overs at Ballinger is something to be cherished.</p> <p>Peter Petrie and Ian Hardy then set about the job of winning the game for Ballinger but## unfortunately## no-one has taught Ian how to play leg spin or Peter to play left arm over. Having hit 4 fours Peter obviously felt every ball should go the same way so was bowled round his legs and Ian was put out of his misery when someone was finally in the right place to catch him.</p> <p>Kim hughes played a brief cameo to end his season and then we were treated to a demonstration of how easy batting is if executed correctly.</p> <p>Joe Hankinson(61*) and Rob McIntyre(43*) traded shots whilst they took the Waggoners past the finish post. It was difficult to believe that one hadn't played cricket for years and the other was only 15.&nbsp;27 overs was all it took for the home side to overhaul Ley Hill's score&nbsp;</p> <p>Every now and again the captain of a team gets to sit in the armchair whilst his team go about the job of winning a game.

647,<p>Widmer End's skipper was dealt a rotten hand when two of his players cried off on the morning of the match## leaving him down to nine. Winning the toss## he had little choice but to ask Ballinger to bat## and given their parlous league position## Ballinger were unlikely to be over sympathetic. The pitch rapidly started to break up## and WESM's opening bowlers made Ballinger fight for every run## to start with. Matt Riley## Paul Humphreys and Richard O'Kelly all perished## victims of good catches. However## with such limited resources## WESM had no option but to go to their second string bowlers## and the result was a run-fest## as Ian Davies## Jack Maciver## and Rhodri Webster laid into some wayward offerings with a vengeance. Ian achieved a personal milestone with his maiden ton## and it was noted by certain connoisseurs of the game that## remarkably## he scored some of these with leg-side shots. Be that as it may## congrats## Ian ! Rhodri was playing his first knock of the season## and notched up a very handy 62. The return of the opening bowlers slowed up proceedings markedly## and BWCC closed on 259 for 9## using their full 45 overs.</p> <p>Key to the WESM reply was always going to be their danger men## G Pearson and B Saeed. Get them out## it was reckoned## and Ballinger should cruise home. In the event## a couple of early wickets were snaffled## but then the aforesaid duo got going. However## Jack Hankinson bowled a mean spell of 7 overs## conceding only 11 runs and taking a vital wicket (after missing a dolly caught &amp; bowled chance !)## as Saeed took one risk too many.. Pearson batted on## steadily running out of partners## until he was last out in a valiant but vain attempt to save the day## as Ballinger wrapped up the innings in 33 overs for 136## with Nick Adams the pick of the bowlers with 4 for 49 off his 12 overs.</p> <p>25 more than welcome points for BWCC (but yet again 3 more dropped for no umpire) - a good start to the second half of the season## but they will meet sterner (and more numerous !) opposition than this in their remaining games.</p>,,2010-07-04

680,<p>Haddenham 152 - 10 BWCC 155 - 9</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>On another wonderful sunny day the 2s travelled to one of the less glamorous grounds on the circuit - Haddenham.</p> <p>The skipper lost the toss again and condemend his team to another long hot day in the field. Opening the the bowling with Tom Sperring was always likely to be a gamble as he hadn't played for 10 months but although a little wayward he was no where near as bad as he thought he was and it would all have been much better if the skipper had hung onto a sharp chance at slip.</p> <p>At the other end Evan Webster was producing yet another spell of high class swing bowling which once again frustrated the coach in the skipper. Why can't he do it when playing with his peers? His 6 overs cost a miserly 9 runs and he removed their danger man Pawsey with a beauty.</p> <p>Ben Carlin ( 2-27) replaced Tom and after a couple of wayward overs removed the other opener with help from a good catch by 'keeper Nick Tegg and skipper Kerry made up for his earlier miss with sharp catch at slip. The arrival of Haddenham's Heggie## who is renowned for his big hitting## pushed the skipper into a change of pace with the introduction of Max Maciver's off-spin. At the other end Tom McIntyre was introduced to weave his leg-spin magic. We then saw the contrast in fortunes that can favour bowlers. Max produced an interesting selection of deliveries designed to confuse all as he used as much of the cut part of the pitch as possible. His tally of 6-36 off 7 overs was as much a reflection of the batsmen's abilities rather than Max's skill. Although he did produce a couple of beauties to remove first Heggie then the last of the Haddenham tail. Meanwhile Tom is producing a wonderful demonstration of the leg-spinners art with the batsman absolutely clueless as to how to play him. 1-43 off 10 overs does not reflect how well he bowled.</p> <p>Chasing 152 on an interesting wicket wasn't going to be easy and and Ballinger were grateful in the end for having bowled out Haddenham in only 32 overs. Bastie Richards and Nick Tegg put on 26 for the 2nd wicket but it wasn't until Tom McIntyre joined Tom Sperring(21) that the Waggoners finally made any head way. With both running well between the wickets&nbsp;and Tom Mac in imperious form they added 50 for the 7th wicket. Evan helped Tom add another 20 for the 8th but with only 3 required Tom then committed the cardinal sin of running out his captain. Forcing the skipper to collect the money and leaving the game slightly closer than need be. Fortunately the cool head of Rob McIntyre guided the side home. Tom's 44* was an excellent knock on a difficult track.</p> <p>Having an umpire and a scorer was an added bonus to round off an enjoyable afternoon.</p> <p>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2010-07-15

Surely victory would follow but Prestwood fought back with a fine 55 from L. Capeling and 89 not out from N. Heasey.</p> <p>Tom McIntyre tied down the batsmen bowling superbly for 11 overs with figures of 1-53 which did not reflect how well he bowled as the ball beat the bat on a number of occasions. It was Tom however who removed L. Capeling when Will Smith made a superb stumping off a snorting delivery.</p> <p>Robert Rose came into the attack and was immediately successful## two wickets in his first over## surely victory would now follow.

650,<p>BWCC paid their first visit to Aylesbury Town's ground## lost the toss on a fine and increasingly sunny afternoon## and could have been forgiven for fearing that the Town's batsmen would give them a hard time. But the pitch was not as true early on as it looked## and some excellent bowling by Jack Hankinson saw him take the first couple of wickets with only 31 on the board by the 10th over. A fifty partnership for the third wicket ensued## but then more wickets fell## largely due to a fine 12 over spell by Carlton Siddle (4 for 54)## and a splendid 3 catch haul by skipper Riley (jug next week## Matt?) When the 7th wicket fell at 137 in the 37th over## Ballinger's hopes were high## but alas the tail wagged## and the final total of 198 for 8 was rather more than had been hoped for.</p> <p>Nevertheless## Ballinger started well## with a confident 50 opening partnership by Riley(19) and Humphreys(35). Then Town brought on Talib Hussain## who proceeded to take two wickets in his first three balls## both cleaned bowled. He continued to make mincemeat of Ballinger's middle order##even though Jack Maciver (29)showed some fine shots## finishing with 5 for 20 off 9 overs. However## Carlton Siddle was going well## and## joined by a limping Ian Maciver## they put on 60## looking well on track for a memorable victory when Ian took one risk too many## and ran himself out in the 41st over. Cue frayed nerves and chewed finger nails## as Carlton tried to shepherd the tail## only to fall for a valiant 43 in the final over. It was down to Nick Adams to hit a six off the one and only ball he faced## and with his past record of mighty blows## it seemed a possibility. But the boundaries at Aylesbury are a lot longer than at Ballinger. All Nick could manage was a two - and thus Ballinger fell an agonizing 3 runs short of victory## in a thrilling finish to a thoroughly satisfactory game of cricket.</p>,,2010-07-20
649,<p>According to the MBL website## the result of this match was Holmer Green 280-5## BWCC 160 all out.&nbsp; This was the result submitted to the league## but as no-one&nbsp; from the BWCC team has compiled a report (yet) and the scorebook is only partially ( and very inaccurately) completed## all that can be said is that apparently HG gave Ballinger a good thrashing## with K King making 79 and B King 110## Paul Humphreys taking 3 wickets..

Little did he know.</p> <p>Evan Webster was on fire. By the end of the 7th over## his 4th## he had reduced Cadmore to 22-3. Ben Carlin was struggling to find his line at the other end but finally managed a decent spell(6-0-28-0). He was replaced by Alex Howe who was immediately on the money and soon had the basmen playing and missing. 1-18 off his 8 overs didn't do him justice. Meanwhile Max Maciver had replaced Evan and was starting to weave his magic. At least it was magic this week unlike last week. Cadmore skipper Croft had decided to dig in and was taking no chances but eventually Max persuaded him to try a slog to the short boundary and bowled him. Derek then helped with another good catch and Max finished with 2-26 off 11 overs.</p> <p>Cadmorewere now enjoying their best spell of the game with a partnership of nearly 70 before the recall of Evan quickly put an end to proceedings. Another 4 wickets including an excellent catch by Harry Bartlett behind the stumps was too much for Cadmore and they subsided to 141.</p> <p>This was a high class spell of seam bowling from Evan and record books are being searched. Certainly it's the record for the 2ndX1 and 11.4 - 6-15-7 is top stuff in anyones books.</p> <p>The bowling figures show that an U14 was involved in all the wickets.</p> <p>Max and Peter Petrie set off in pursuit of Cadmore's total and it soon became apparent that it wasn't going to be competitive. Baring a couple of lucky breaks Max was in imperious form. Playing shots all round the wicket hesoon left Peter in his wake.</p> <p>Peter had the daunting prospect of being in a match-winning opening partnership with someone 30+ years his junior who was out scoring him 2-1. He wasn't going to get to 50 and was going to have to collect the money. Fortunately for him## with only 11 required##Max couln't resist a slog atthe new bowler and was LBW for a fine 83.

648,"<p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">Ballinger vs. Hyde Heath## this was the definition of a local derby. With an atmosphere reminiscent of the Milan derby at the San Siro and intensity of a certain World Cup final## this really was a battle of cricketing superpowers! Both teams were clearly ready for the battle that lay ahead of them## this came out especially in the pre-match interviews were respective captains## Salisbury and Samuels## refused to give much away to the capacity crowd of 4 at the Ballinger Common Stadium. As tickets were at a premium both teams knew they would have to put on a show and as the clock edged its way towards 2## Ballinger drew first blood as Salisbury won the toss and elected to bat first on a day that was fast turning into a splendid day for cricket.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">For Ballinger the usual suspects of Will Smith and Paul Humphries opened up and got the home side off to a flier with 15 coming off the first 3 overs## however Will decided to give the HH slips some catching practice by just guiding a ball from Shrimpton straight towards second slip. Unfortunately HH didn&rsquo;t enter into the spirit of things## and unlike so often for Ballinger## the relatively straightforward catch was taken. This brought local hero Joe Hankinson to the crease. Gradually Ballinger rebuilt and Joe began to feast on some of HH&rsquo;s bowling from Stevens and HH&rsquo;s multimillion pound overseas player Amla. Paul was rather subdued at this point and he soon went with the score on 58. This set off a collapse however## much akin to the collapse of Italian agriculture under Mussolini in 1937&hellip; BLAH BLAH BLAH. Anyway it was only the old pro Jeremy Hunting (14)## Tegg (15) and Jack Hankinson (27) that reached double figures as Ballinger were bowled out for a rather disappointing 173 in 40.2 overs with Stevens taking 6 wickets for HH.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">After a typically good Ballinger tea## HH began their reply. The two Jacks## Hankinson and Maciver## opened the bowling and soon had the HH batsmen in trouble. Whilst Capper looked relatively at ease; Haddock looked like&hellip; a fish out of water! Despite beating the bat on numerous occasions the HH opening pair started to accumulate runs and it brought a bowling change that put an end to the partnership. McGowan steadied the sinking Ballinger ship as he introduced a measure of calm## as the run rate was stifled by some intelligent bowling. As a result Capper&rsquo;s runs had been capped and he departed for 21 as he gave a caught and bowled to McGowan who took the catch at the third attempt## whilst doing his best to impersonate a circus performer! This brought Shrimpton to the crease and whilst Shrimp and Haddock is more widely seen on the menus of fish restaurants## the stormy Ballinger waters were too much for him as he was caught by Salisbury off fisherman&rsquo;s friend## Jack Maciver. 2 wickets down soon became 3 as Napier-Munn was cleaned up by the impressive Maciver who was bowling like a cod (or should that be god?). Suddenly Ballinger sensed a way back into the match. Unfortunately Holt played a sensible innings and moved HH to within reach of the target## meanwhile Haddock was still scoring runs but was getting well and truly battered by the Ballinger attack and on many occasions went fishing outside his off stump although Ballinger could never reel him in. However once geography genius Dom Birkby had gotten rid of Holt with the worst ball of the day## Haddock soon was caught. Maciver bowled an absolute kipper of a delivery## Haddock took the bait and &lsquo;safe hands&rsquo; Salisbury took the catch. Out &ndash; hook## line and sinker for a decent 75! With 5 down## was their really a chance of an unlikely victory for Ballinger?

Phoenix are the current table toppers and look set to gain promotion to Div. 2## however Ballinger did enjoy a relatively comfortable victory in the reverse fixture earlier in the season. So the question on everyone&rsquo;s lips was whether or not Phoenix would continue there winning ways or would Ballinger rise from the ashes much like a&hellip; Phoenix## and claim quite a scalp.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Having lost the toss Ballinger were put into the field and the mix of youthful exuberance and experience at first capped the Phoenix run scoring with Joe Hankinson and Evan Webster bowling well. However no wicket was taken and Phoenix began to get into their stride as Jackson especially started to bludgeon the Ballinger bowling attack around. Unfortunately for Ballinger bowling changes did not stop the momentum and whilst wickets fell steadily at one end Jackson continued his onslaught## helped considerably by Ballinger&rsquo;s profligacy in the field## dropping him 8 times! In the end he went for one too many big hits and was stumped by Will Smith for 159## Phoenix then very sportingly declared soon after with the score on 260 off 40 overs.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">In reply Ballinger were up against it with the required rate up around 7 right from the off. This however did phase Ballinger&rsquo;s young batting line up and Max Maciver and Will Smith played very positively with both particularly strong off the back foot. The partnership however was broken when Max was caught at slip unluckily for 47 and soon after Harry Bartlett followed. The brought Bastie Richards (47) to the crease and he straight away took the attack to the Phoenix bowlers with some crushing blows on the leg side. With Ballinger still in with a shout of winning the game Will eventually fell for an excellent 80 and Joe Hankinson came and in and out in quick time. As Ballinger started going for there shots and pressurising the opposition##<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>more wickets fell## which left Rob McIntyre (23)## Tom McIntyre (12*) and Nigel Kerry (2*) to bat Ballinger out for the draw at 239-7.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">Overall this was an excellent game played in good spirit and a very good result against top the table opposition.

652,<p>Nearly an hour into the match - J Cox (Downley's prolific opener and serial destroyer of BWCC) going ominously well - the ball soars upward and straight down into the waiting hands of Paul Humphreys - then out of them onto the parched turf. Ballinger joy turns to instant grief. Paul wishes aforesaid turf would open and swallow him (as did the bowler).</p> <p>Having lost yet another toss ## but seen his ploy of opening with spin (Ian Maciver) pay off with a wicket in the first over##and the Downley No 3 virtually strokeless against very tight bowling from Maciver## and especially Nick Adams(12 overs for only 18 runs## but undeservedly no wickets)## skipper Riley must have thought## as that ball flew skywards## that at last it was going to be his day. But in fact Cox was to add only 1 run to his score before being comprehensively bowled by Ian Davies (cue display of unbridled exstatic joy by bowler). After this reverse## The Downley batsmen dug in## but steadily became more aggressive## the change bowlers suffered accordingly## and the 4th wicket did not fall until 176 was on the board## with 38 overs gone. Two excellent run-outs## and Ballinger had hopes of wrapping up the innings for under 200## but as last week## the tail wagged## and the innings closed on 225-8## with Ian Maciver (limping again## hamstring this time !)the chief wicket taker ( 4 for 52).</p> <p>In reply## Ballinger's early batting failed for once## and 3 wickets were down for 31. However## Rollo(25) and Richard O'Kelly(24) repaired the damage for a while## but with 7 down for a mere 113## and 29 overs gone## the target of 226 looked a far distant dream. Not for the first time the Maciver family had other ideas. Jack was striking the ball cleanly and hard## and Ian## making light of the hamstring## took every half chance of a run. They had put on 62 for the 8th wicket before Jack fell for a fine 43## with 6 overs left. By this time Downley were visibly rattled at the prospect of losing a match that had for long seemed in the bag.

Unfortunately for Ballinger things did not start too well with both Paul Humphreys and Will Smith going early. However with the score on a precarious 33-2## Joe Hankinson and James Wood steadied the ship with a partnership of 70 before Joe went for 28.

This however brought Slade and Beardmore to the crease and both started to play with a bit more freedom as the Ballinger change bowlers came on. Jake Cutter bowled well on the while whilst Phil Lloyd was his usual steady self. However it brought another change of bowling that brought the prized wicket## Phil Doyle having Beardmore caught off his first ball by Jake Cutter. This led to a mini collapse as 4 wickets fell quickly## however this did not change the cause of the result as Beasley and Wareman saw Long Marston home with 6 overs## finishing on 224-6.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">Overall this was another good game played in good spirit at a very good ground.

654,<p>Another close and interesting match. Our first encounter of the season with bottom-of-the-league Chesham Bois## the earlier fixture having been rained off## this was the match that Ballinger had to win if they&nbsp;are to stand much chance of survival in the premier division. Fortuitously## a good start## in that yet again skipper Riley called wrongly## but found himself invited to bat first## which he would have done anyway had he won. However## evidently Chesham Bois had a fair idea that the pitch would misbehave - which indeed it did. Three Ballinger wickets were down by the 9th over## and a mere 28 on the board. A rescue mission was launched by Rollo and Jack Maciver## both batting sensibly. Together they put on 63 (the game's highest stand by far) ## but in the 24th over Rollo departed for a hard-hitting 41## rapidly followed by Jack for 27. Thereafter none of the remaining batsmen could survive the vagaries of the pitch## though a dogged last wicket partnership by Ian Maciver (17) and Jack Hankinson saw Ballinger crawl to a final total of 135## with 4.5 overs unused.</p> <p>With plenty of time to get the runs## the odds were all in favour of Chesham Bois## and indeed ## although there was unsurprisingly a lot of playing and missing## Ballinger did not achieve a breakthrough until the 13th over## by which time the score was already 41. Nick Adams (4-39) was causing problems from the far end## but any loose balls were promptly dispatched to the boundary## and neither of the two young Jacks could work any magic from the pavilion end. However## wickets were falling - two in the 40's## two in the 70's## and 4 in the 90's## with Ian Maciver (4-27)&nbsp;getting us into what seemed likley to be a winning position with score at 98 for 8. Then it all went wrong. Two difficult catches went down## the score crept steadily upwards## and Ballinger were simply unable to break a ninth wicket partnership that eventually yielded 38 runs and saw Chesham Bois home by 2 wickets.</p> <p>A very disappointing result## but too many&nbsp;of Ballinger's batsmen did not perform## and left the bowlers around 30 runs short of a defendable target.

731,<p>A visit to bottom of the table Prestwood should be an opportunity to 'fill your boots' as a batsman or make significant improvements to your bowling average.Unfortunately this doesn't seem to happen when we play them.</p> <p>Having won the toss skipper Kerry was very happy to be able to choose to not bat first on what looked a very dodgy wicket.(dodgy only because we're being spoilt by the quality of the wickets at HQ.) He was then a bit non-plussed by only having 7 players to start the match with. 'keeper Harry Bartlett arrived in the nick of time and with Harri Doyle substituting for the missing 3 players off we went.</p> <p>Of the missing three##&nbsp;two thought they were playing on Sunday and&nbsp;the other##&nbsp;having only been playing league cricket for the club for about five years## thought it was a 2pm start. Commendably the the two made it from Beaconsfield## home## changed and to the ground within 30mins of the start.</p> <p>To the game. Evan Webster and Tom Sperring(0-27) opened for the Waggoners and both kept the Prestwood openers under control. In fact when Evan bowled Kinsman in the 10th over the skipper was a little peaved because it meant opening the door for Prestwood's Capeling. This is a player who should be&nbsp;competing at a higher level. He scores runs against us every time we play them and this was to be no exception. He opened his scoring with a straight six off Evan that &nbsp;disappeared out of the ground and over the farm opposite. He then hit Tom for another enormous six.</p> <p>The skipper decided that a change of pace and a bit of experience was needed. This meant the introduction of Max 'Bat and Bowl'Maciver and Phil LLoyd. He couldn't play Max and Phil bowled too tight a line to him## add some&nbsp;very defensive field placings and we finally slowed him down. Unfortunately Capeling(47) and opener Greaves were still ticking along at 5 an over.&nbsp;Greaves was run out by a brilliant bit of fielding by Phil LLoyd but this was topped by a fantastic catch by Monty Thompson to remove Capeling.</p> <p>Alex Howe was then introduced into the attack and produced a couple of beauties to rest control back to Ballinger and it looked like 130 was going to be the hight of the home sides ambition. Unfortunately## once again we were confounded by some late order hitting by the Prestwood batters. Monty(1-31) and Evan(3-55)&nbsp;bore the brunt of this but it was good to see both Evan and Tom bowling decent spells at the death. 187 was probably 30 more than the home side should have reached.</p> <p>It's taken me six paragraphs to describe the start of the game and our fielding efforts. The batting is somewhat more straight forward.Max and Harry put on 152 for the 1st wicket &nbsp;with Max out in the 27th over for 65 followed by&nbsp;Harry in the 28th for 74.&nbsp;They were helped by some very generous fielders but frankly they are both&nbsp;too good for this level of cricket.

656,<p>For once## fortune smiled on Ballinger. The cream of Knotty Green's bowlers had departed for a wedding in Italy## and Matt Riley had at last won the toss. Not that his decision to bat first## given Ballinger's recent batting performances## and a wicket soft on top from overnight and morning rain##was clear-cut. As it was## Ballinger were off to an exceptionally watchful start## with the scoreboard reading just 6 after 7 overs. Then Paul Humphreys launched into a series of huge 6's## doubtless influenced by his mammoth innings of the previous Sunday. But when in full flow and seeming likely to endanger the record books again## he checked a shot and offered a tame catch - out for 28. Matt## after facing an initial 26 dot balls## then got going and kept Ian Davies company until he was out for an increasingly confident 38## with the total on 74. Ian saw the 100 up## but was then the first victim of two Caught &amp; Bowled dismissals off consecutive balls. Jack Maciver as usual was batting with increasing authority## but fell for 37. With the total now 130## 6 wickets down## and 34 overs gone## the scene was set for another below-par Ballinger score. Except that Andy Thompson## with a superlative 55 not out## and Ian Maciver (26 n.o) had other ideas. In the remaining 11 overs they put together an undefeated stand of 82## showing great enterprise with quick singles## and took Ballinger to a praiseworthy 212 - 6 at 45 overs.</p> <p>Tea coincided with a heavy shower## but play soon got under way## and Knotty Green## after losing a key wicket to Jack Hankinson's second ball yorker## had reached 43 for 2 by the time more## and heavier## rain arrived. By the time the pitch had drained sufficiently to allow play to resume## 9 overs' play had been lost## and KG's attentions turned to achieving a winning draw based on run-rate## Messrs Duckworth/Lewis having not yet influenced the Mid-Bucks League law-makers.. They had advanced their total to 54 before man-of-the-match first change bowler Andy Thompson struck. 54 for 2 became 78 all out in the space of 9 overs## as the hapless KG batsmen were comprehensively destroyed by Thompson (5 for 20) and Paul Humphreys ( 3 for 9)## backed up by excellent fielding and catching. Skipper Riley## keeping wicket for the first time this season in a league match## was particularly pleased with his two catches and one miserly bye!</p> <p>Perhaps too late to stave off relegation## but nevertheless a very satisfying result## and a great day for the Thompsons - ten year old Freddie## called up at the last minute## fielded splendidly at fine leg. Lots of jugs at the Old Swan afterwards rounded off a good day for BWCC.</p>,,2010-08-09
657,"<p>BWCC 291-4 40 overs &nbsp; The Lee CC 145 AO 39 overs</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">In sport there the odd occasions where a game## be it football or cricket etc## are so one sided that one could use words such as a &lsquo;destruction&rsquo;## or a &lsquo;pasting&rsquo;. Notable recent examples that spring to mind immediately would be the demolition of Germany in Berlin by the England football team in the run up to the 2002 world cup and the hammering handed out by Australia to American Samoa in the qualifiers for the same tournament. The score on this occasion was a scarcely believable 36-0!! Whilst Ballinger&rsquo;s comprehensive victory over The Lee on the 8<sup>th</sup> August was not world record breaking it was certainly record breaking: highest first wicket partnership and biggest winning margin for starters. Anyway to the game&hellip; (the author of this report was not actually at the game so please allow for some poetic license!).</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">It was a fine day as the mighty men of Ballinger drove the short distance to the picturesque and pleasant ground which is home to The Lee. This was billed as a battle of the heavyweights and even had the usually reserved Daily Telegraph columnist Henry Winter salivating at the prospect of such cricketing giant&rsquo;s battle out to the death. Ballinger captain Salisbury## did not comment as he arrived but was whisked off to the changing rooms away from all the hype of the following media circus. The steely expression that engrossed his face however said all that was needed; this was a big game for his experienced side. As the crowd filtered in## the team sheets were handed in and Ballinger lined up strongly with Riley making a return to the Sunday side along with Draper making his second (?) appearance of the season. Meanwhile the usual suspects of Hankinson&rsquo;s## Kellock## Maciver and Humphreys made up an awe inspiring line up!</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">With the pitch freshly cut## painted and stumps grounded## play was ready to commence. The Lee won the first battle as they correctly called the coin toss and chose to have a bowl in what would be a 40 over win/lose shootout. Opening up for Ballinger were Riley and Draper. Both began slowly but as time went on both found there stride and Ballinger were rocketing along at a very healthy rate with Riley particularly punishing anything that was short and wide. Ballinger were soon past 100 with no real scares and then 150 was pasted too. With the pair serenely progressing on the record books were scrambled and as they edged closer to 200 the record for the first wicket partnership was getting even closer. Inevitably Ballinger did lose a wicket but not however after Riley and Draper wrote themselves into the annals of Ballinger Waggoners history with the highest first wicket partnership ever. It really was a pleasure to watch (for those there!) such fine cricket! The wicket that fell was that of Riley who creamed a cover drive over The Lee in field&hellip; or so he thought. Unfortunately the cover fielder leapt like a salmon 5ft of the ground and plucked it one handed. Amazing. Out for 86 hitting 11 fours and 2 sixes. (Please note I haven&rsquo;t a clue if that is accurate## all I know is Matt was caught!). Anyway 212-1 soon 219-2 as Draper## who had brought his century in style by smashing the ball to the point boundary fell for a magnificent 107 hitting 19 fours and 1 six in the process. Enter Joe Hankinson and Jeremy Hunting. With overs running out Hankinson continued his fine form smashing the bowling all over the place with a very rapid 45 which included 8 fours and 1 six. When Joe fell Kellcok unfortunately could not join the party as he fell for 1 but Jeremy and Jack Maciver took Ballinger to the close without any further loss## with Ballinger finishing on a towering 291-4 off their allotted 40 overs.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">Following another superb tea from The Lee## Ballinger may well have been excused for starting slowly but were right on the button straight away with the Jack duo bowling fast and straight. Jack Hankinson was his usual economic self whilst Jack Maciver provided a superb exhibition of fast bowling taking 5-20 of his 10 overs; it was no surprise then that he was mobbed by autograph hunters at the end of the game. Stuart MacGowan was also his steady self as he ripped through The Lee&rsquo;s middle order with an expert spell of off spin bowling that claimed 3 wickets in a very economical 7 over spell. The other wicket taker was Salisbury who somehow managed to bore the batsmen into submission! Fallowfield-Smith## Kellock and Joe Hankinson also turned their arms over but to no avail. With 7 wickets being bowled the only catch fell to Paul Humphreys. Whilst I would love to say it involved diving 30 yards to his right and plucking it one handed## something tells it may have been a regulation slip catch! So whilst Ballinger&rsquo;s bowling was exemplary## Morrison (45) and Jones (35) did put up some fighting resilience that was so lacking in The Lee&rsquo;s batting but unfortunately their stand only delayed the inevitable and eventually The Lee were bowled out for 145 in 39 overs## meaning a winning margin of 146 runs## another club record.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">From what I can see this was a thoroughly professional Ballinger performance against a side that was not at full strength. Two club records were broken and in Danny Draper and Jack Maciver Ballinger had 2 very creditable candidates for man of the match. Well played guys!<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2010-08-16

As the team arrived## the ground superb despite the recent heavy rainfall but Ballinger had bigger concerns. Who was their11th man?

Unfortunately Paul departed early unluckily having played on. At this point the pitch was not playing too well and the ball was moving all over. Next man Tom Maw and Will began to rebuild for Ballinger. Gradually they took the score on although it did take 8 or so overs for Tom to get off the mark. However with the score on 40 Will edged Cublington&rsquo;s overseas Australian to first slip and Ballinger were once again in trouble. Jeremy Hunting then joined Tom and both started to accumulate runs and soon enough the Ballinger 100 was up. Unfortunately with the score on 133 Tom got bored and tried to smash the ball out of the park and got bowled for a very patient 43## meanwhile Jeremy began to accelerate the Ballinger innings as wickets started to fall regularly at the other end. Eventually Jeremy fell for an excellent 61 and Ballinger subsided to 187 all out of 37 overs## 3 short of their allotted 40. Cublington&rsquo;s stand out bowler was their overseas Westlands who took 4 wickets including a hat-trick.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">In reply Cublington started very slowly due to some excellent bowling by the young Ballinger attack. Jack Hankinson recorded excellent figures## conceding only 5 runs on his 6.3 overs whilst taking 3 wickets. Mr Cricket Dom Birkby was even more economical## recording figures of 8-3-11-1. An excellent display from Nottingham University&rsquo;s No. 1 Geographer. Whilst Jono Lacey also bowled well it was Joe Hankinson that ripped the heart out of Cublington&rsquo;s innings including the prized wicket of Westlands. Although the Cublington lower order put up some creditable lower order resistance it was the superb bowling of Graham Salisbury and Tom Maw that did for Cublington who end on 130 all out. An excellent victory by 57 runs. The Ballinger machine rumbles on&hellip;</span></p> </p>",,2010-08-16

660,<p>There was a lot of damage arising from this match against Monks Risborough## mostly in the form of dented vehicles and dented bowling figures. Under overcast skies## stand-in skipper Davies performed a minor miracle (his only one of the day) by winning the toss## and with a strong batting line-up## decided to take first knock. There followed a heartwarming exhibition of cultured batting by openers Paul Humphreys and Richard O'Kelly. The score had rattled along at six an over until Richard was caught (in flagrant jug-avoidance) for 49## the partnership having yielded 129. Paul## batting with serene confidence## was stroking the ball effortlessly around the park## until## with his score on 96## made a complete mess of a straight one - 165 for 2. Meanwhile Rollo too was cashing in on a pitch which was actually not as easy (the batsmen claimed) as the run-rate made it appear. The score continued to mount at a most un-Ballinger rate## and Ian Davies (having narrowly avoided subs-collection duties) after much pondering declared the innings closed after 44 overs## on 281 for 6.</p> <p>Past experience with the Monks Risborough approach to batting indicated that they were perfectly capable of a Pakistan (or England) style collapse## or blasting their way towards (or past) 300 with ease. Ballinger had an attack that was missing only Nick Adams## and so had every hope of success. Instead## they got wallopped all over the place## with only two bowlers achieving respectable figures - Andy Thompson## with another excellent 12 over spell taking 5 for 69## and Jack Hankinson (11 overs## 2 for 49). There were no dropped catches## the fielding was exemplary - but the opposition batsmen## notably R Shah (97) were simply too good## taking the aerial route to the boundary with depressing frequency## and reached their target with 7 wickets down## and 2.5 overs to spare.</p> <p>A veritable run-fest## and Mr Kellock (DNB) was indeed proud of his pitch ! Most enjoyable## just a pity we didn't win.</p>,,2010-08-23

Phil Lloyd## introduced into the attack## following an early injury to Ben Carlin## provided the backbone to the team's bowling with two spells totalling 11 overs in which he claimed 1-32.</p> <p>The initial burst from the seamers was then taken up by the young spinners## each of whom bowled superbly. Max maciver with 2-35 of 8 overs## Jake Cutter with 3-37 off 6 overs ans Rob Rose with 2-17 off 4 overs.</p> <p>The outcome was that astrong and experienced Frieth side were restricted to 194-8 off 39 overs by the fine ballinger bowling performance## well supported by some fine fielding## Tom Sperring and Max Maciver in particular.</p> <p>Ballinger## in reply## had an early wobble which saw the early removal of Max Maciver and Will Smith. Enter the stand in skipper with a defiant knock in support of a sublime innings from Rob McIntyre. The innings resumed on course until the score reached 59 when Richards fell.</p> <p>Tom McIntyre was next to the crease and produced a superb innings. Both Rob and Tom took the match to Frieth and their partnership was a superb display from both players. Unfortunately Rob perished chasing runs and the later batsmen were unable to continue to match the required strike rate despite valiant attemts from Sebastian Richards and Phil Lloyd to support Tom McIntryre. In the end Tom McIntyre and Tom Sperring saw the match out to a draw with Ballinger finishing on 179 for 7.</p> <p>On a personal note## many thanks to Phil Lloyd## who has probably played his last match for Ballinger. Phil's enthusiasm and support for the younger players will be sorely missed and all at the Club wish him well.&nbsp;</p> <p>All in all## a very enjoyable afternoon in a match which was played in exactly the right manner and many thanks to Frieth for their sporting performance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2010-08-23

687,<p>This was a disappointing end to another excellent season for the 2s. Not only because the rain curtailed the game but the manner in which the team played wasn't to the standards set throughout the summer. In particular the bowling wasn't as good as we have come to expect. Some interesting umpiring plus some wayward bowling meant we bowled 22 wides and 7 no-balls. Basically we gave the visitors another 5 overs to bat.</p> <p>Neave## Waddesdons opener scored an excellent 112 but he was very limited in the shots he could play and most were of the leg-side variety. Unfortunately on a slow pitch all the bowlers gave him plenty of opportunities to practice them. Alex Howe was probably the pick with 2-25 in his 7 overs. Evan Webster took another 4 wickets in what has been an excellent season for him## but even he had to agree that he wasn't quite at his best in this game.</p> <p>Skipper Kerry won the toss and put Waddesdon in on what he thought was likely to be a difficult pitch to bat on. Unfortunately the fact that nearly 900 runs were scored on it last week should have been more of a guide as although slow it played very well. As mentioned above the Ballinger bowlers didn't make the visitors work too hard for their runs. A decent ball from Evan and a sharp catch by Kerry produced the first two wickets but Waddesdons 3rd wicket stand of over 100 took the game away from the home side.</p> <p>260 was always likely to be too many for Ballingers young side but the visitors had been reading about the teams exploits&nbsp;over the last few weeks and weren't going to take any chances.</p> <p>Tim Rix opened up with Max Dugdale and was looking forward to taking a final opportunity of the season to notch a decent score. Unfortunately the visitors umpire had other ideas. Max followed shortly but then an excellent stand between Sebastian Richards(43) and Ben Carlin (34*) which included some very fine shots plus some rather excentric running between the wickets. The demise of Sebastian brought in Ben Dugdale who only lasted a couple of balls before being replaced by the debutant Miles Dugdale. A well struck 4 and a scampered single&nbsp;ensured that Dugdale senior wasn't the lowest scorer in this family battle.</p> <p>Alex Howe replaced Miles and he and Ben were at the crease when the heavens opened. The league rules state that the side batting lose and over for every 3 minutes they game is held up. As the side batting second we were already only going to get 40 overs&nbsp;as opposed to the visitors 45. There is no reduction in the total to chase so therefore at the&nbsp;end of the break we&nbsp;only had 11 overs to chase the total. An unlikely event so the stumps were drawn with the home side on 106-5.</p> <p>It's been a really enjoyable season again&nbsp;with another crop of youngsters coming to the fore and another couple of dads coming out of the wood-work. I would like to thank all those who've helped out over the season especially Veronica Richards for organising the teas and all the ladies for doing the teas. Derek and Tim for taking over when events took me to other places and finally to the grounds team for producing such good pitches.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2010-08-29
852,<p>It is debatable what was more remarkable about this## BWCC's first match of the 2011 season at Aldenham.&nbsp; Was it the weather? - hot and sunny - very unlike April## when we are used to anything from sleet## gales and general meteorological misery. Was it the fact that no-one can remember Ballinger playing a match on Easter Sunday? Or was it the unexpected outcome of the game?</p> <p>Skipper Ian Davies won the toss## and our batsmen made a steady start with an opening partnership of 54 between Paul Humphreys (38) andWill Smith (18). Andy Thompson (30) carried on the good work## then Max Maciver blitzed an aggressive 37. Ian Davies took ther batting honours with an unbeaten 55## but Aldenham's bowlers kept the batsmen tied down towards the end## and a total of 227-5 when the declaration came looked a few runs short of comfortable.</p> <p>And so it seemed## when Aldenham batted## Ballinger's first four bowlers all went wicketless (though errant line and length## plus a critical dropped catch## contributed to that)## and the first wicket did not fall until the score was 103## in only the 22nd over. Opening bat Monroe then mounted a savage attack## but with the total on 164 and only 34 overs gone## he unaccountably ran himself out for 92. This prompted one of the more remarkable collapses. Bastie took a hat-trick in an extraordinary spell of 5 - 21 (6 of which were no-balls!)## two more batsmen ran themselves out## and their 11th man was found to have gone home## as Aldenham sank from 164-1 to 183 all out.</p> <p>An excellent way to start the season!</p>,,2011-04-26
782,<p>An excellent win for Ballinger by 79 runs gave the U10A's a&nbsp;great start to the season. Beautiful sunshine## although a little on the chilly side. Tractor mended and pitch marked in the nick of time.</p> <p>An eager U10 team## captained by Monty won the toss and chose to bat first. A little reluctant to chase the singles at first## and scored 44 runs off the bat## benefiting from 51 extras and 9 byes given away by High Wycombe. Top run scorers: Henry K (9)## and Hugo E-H (8)## Monty W (8) and James B (8). Final score: 256</p> <p>The boys bowled and fielded really well with some excellent wicket keeping from Hugo. The bowling was accurate## only giving away 16 in extras which was a good start for the first game of the season. The fielding was tight## the backing up excellent## so all the hard work in coaching and practising has really paid off. They never lost their concentration or determination in the field which really put the pressure on the HWCC batsmen## who only scored 19 off the bat and lost 10 wickets. Final score: 177</p> <p>Top bowlers: James B (1 run## 3 wickets## 3 overs); Monty (3&nbsp;runs## 2 wickets## 3 overs) and&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis &amp; Will both bowled 2 for 2 off 2.</p> <p>So a really good win - well done boys!

817,<p>Another sunny day## another win!</p> <p>Pelicans## having won the toss## decided that they didn't fancy batting first on what looked like a Kellock belter## and Ballinger had cruised to an opening partnership of 50 in only 10 overs when Paul Humphreys went LBW for an impressive 43. When comments are made before an innings about the depth of the Ballinger batting## one can guess that the inevitable will ensue - as indeed it did. Six overs later the scoreboard read 64 for 5! Some sensible batting was called for## and was duly delivered by Jeremy Hunting## assisted first by Jamie Kellock## who was determined to prove that his pitch had nothing to do with the earlier clatter of wickets## and then by Ian Davies## with an accomplished 25. Jeremy went on to an extremely well-struck 67## then Bastie (29)and Jack Hankinson went after the bowling to post a final total of 210.</p> <p>Pelicans could make little headway against an extremely accurate opening attack of Andy Thompson and Jack Hankinson. Wickets fell steadily## and Ian Davies joined the fray once Jack's allotted spell was done. Andy finished with 4 for 38 off 13 overs - impressive stuff - and Pelicans subsided to an all-out total of 143.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Gerry Hunting</p>,,2011-05-02

799,<p>In our first game of the season## Ballinger acquitted themselves well. &nbsp;Chesham fielded a strong B team for this cup game and put on some good bowling. &nbsp;The top 3## Freddie## Monty and Hamish all batted well albeit a little slowly. &nbsp;Greg hit his first runs on debut. The highlight though was the Sam Peters (also on debut) and Henry Turrell## who came in with the score rate looking a little weak; between then## they put on 43 runs for the last 4 overs; Henry in particular scored a very fast 27 off 16 balls.</p> <p>Ballinger's fielding was very strong; everyone contributed with some dynamic dives. &nbsp;The ball spent a lot of time in the air with some good tight bowling but it never quite went to hand. &nbsp;The team came off rightly satisfied with a good win## albeit in a match which we should always win.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-05-07
800,<p>A missed opportunity. &nbsp;Chasing 119## we were 60 off 10 overs with only 1 wicket down. &nbsp;From this position## Ballinger contrived to score only 31 runs from the last last 9 wickets; whilst disappointed with the result## I was happy with the team performance. &nbsp;Going by form in the Division## Chesham are the side to beat and we were not fielding a full-strength team - missing 4 of our strongest players.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ballinger bowling in general was good. &nbsp;I thinkChesham were surprised by the depth of our bowling as they played out the openners patiently expecting to be able to score freely after this. All of our bowlers caused them problems. &nbsp;Hamish and Reece (on debut) are a good openning pair; Dom gave away just 10 runs and no extra's from his 4 overs## getting one of the two wickets. Greg had a useful spell and then Freddie and Monty arrived late and between them bowled 4 overs for just 10 runs. &nbsp; Fielding let us down this time and the difference between the two sides was the extra's - Ballinger tally being 32 compared to Chesham's 6 - 12 of these extras were 4's behind the wickets. NB Toby kept pretty well taking some difficult leg side balls at pace well - we just need to give him a bit more fielding support behind the stumps.</p> <p>Openning pair again did their job; Freddie (29) and Monty (17) make a good partnership taking every run available - if anything erring towards a little too much risk. Hamish came in and played a quick 22 pushing the run rate along. &nbsp;Then on came County spinner## Sam Rance## giving a masterclass in line and length and Ballinger were suddenly 81 for 8. Playing spinners is definitely a skill which this team is lacking. &nbsp;The only player who was able to cope with spin was Matt O'Kelly## who played a good rear-guard 10 not out and looked strong.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-05-07

742,<p>BWCC's 2011 league campaign started with a first-ever visit to Potten End## newly promoted to the MBL premier division. A little overnight rain perhaps influenced Ian Davies## successful with the coin## to field first## as the wicket looked as if it might play a few tricks.Not that the first Potten End wicket to fall - first ball## first over - had anything to do with the pitch.The batsman## surprised by a rank Nick Adams full-toss## swatted it straight to an equally surprised Danny Draper (making what we hope will be regular league appearances)## who clung on. There followed a rather extraordinary period in which the normally&nbsp;miserly Nick was given some rough treatment## whilst Andy Thompson opened with five consecutive maidens. With 82 on the board before the 4th wicket fell## Potten End were going along nicely. The introduction of Carlton Siddle changed all that## and 83-3 suddenly became 83-7## with Ballinger's oft-maligned fielders taking some smart catches. A stand of 43 for the 8th wicket hauled Potten End out of the mire## only for Rollo to enter the fray and show how easy bowling really is## with 2 wickets in 9 balls! Which must have been small consolation to Andy## whose analysis of 11 overs## 7 maidens## no wickets for 17 runs was a travesty for such fine## accurate bowling.</p> <p>A target of 138 to win - should be easy?&nbsp; Had Potten End's opening bowlers not&nbsp;both been 18 year olds## and thus restricted to 7 over spells by ECB regulations## things might have been very different. Paul Humphreys (0 in 6 balls) claimed that only a batsman as good as himself would have even got an edge to the ball that did him (such modesty!)## and Danny and Rollo struggled hard to raise the score to 25 before Danny went. Rollo followed with the score on 38## but with&nbsp;the enforced change in bowling## the pressure eased a little. Ian Davies batted well for 32## but the starring role went to Carlton## whose hard-hit 53 not out## coupled with his earlier 4 wickets for 31## capped a fine personal performance. Potten End rang the changes with their attack##but to no avail## as Ballinger emerged winners by 5 wickets.</p> <p>A very welcome opening victory## enhanced by the 3 points gained by having an UMPIRE !! - thanks to Ian Hardy## destined to play for the&nbsp;2nds## whose game had to be called off due to shortage of players## and who preferred to assist the club## rather than indulge in lawn-mowing## shopping## or any other alluring Saturday afternoon activity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-05-09
783,<p>BWCC U10's won the toss again and chose to bat first. A much more confident batting side this week having worked hard the previous Saturday at calling and running between the wickets.

755,"<p>With skipper Davies away (basking in Barcelona)## Ian Maciver## deputising## had little hesitation having won the toss in choosing to bat on a perfect wicket that looked full of runs. Matt Riley (on free loan from Eymet Club de Cricket## Dordogne) and Paul Humphreys gave Ballinger a good start## posting 91 by the 20th over## but thereafter none of the batsmen could really get on top of&nbsp;accurate bowling backed up by athletic fielding (regrettably to an endless chorus of ""shabash##shabash""). Two uneccessary run-outs didn't help. Nick Adams came in early to clout 12 off 5 balls## and Carlton Siddle batted well (again) ## holding the tail togther. Carlton and Ian Maciver produced a flurry of runs (19) in the 44th over## to raise a total of 213 -9## which was satisfying## but on such a wicket## a far from unbeatable score.</p> <p>Cadmore End were soon scoring well## but 4 wickets were down for 76## and Ballinger seemed to have the match in hand. However## their catching was fallible - 5 chances went down - and some loose bowling let Cadmore End back into the game and a partnership of 87 for the 5th wicket ensued. Ballinger were denied a run-out by their own umpire being badly positioned (but## being gentlemen## only reminded him of this half a dozen times thereafter). Ian Maciver then brought himself into the attack## and with the later Cadmore End batsmen unable to keep up with the run-rate## finished with 4 for 44## as BWCC wrapped up the match in the final over## a match which in truth they should have won much more convincingly.</p> <p>For the second week running## two junior players were brought into the team## due to absence of seniors## and once again acquitted themselves really well in the the field - a credit to the club's junior section and their coaches.</p>",,2011-05-15
741,"<p>Cadmore End is always an interesting place to visit for your first game of the season. It's unusual shaped ground plus the vagaries&nbsp;of the pitch can make a skippers life very interesting.</p> <p>With the 1s having taken the only strike bowler in the squad skipper Kerry was left with a bit of a quandary as to what to do when he won the toss. Eventually the uncertainty as to how the pitch would behave was enough for him to choose to field.</p> <p>Opening the bowling with an off spinner and a leg spinner doesn't often happen in any form of cricket but for the first 4 overs everything looked very comfortable for the Waggoners especially as there were only nine fielders on the pitch. Our 10th man arrived and was quickly in to the action.</p> <p>Reece Tiley is a new U13 recruit for the club but the pace he was able to generate on this very slow pitch was impressive and bodes well for the future. He was first to draw blood with 2 wickets in only his 4th over for the 2s. Jake Cutter's leg spin had been moved to the pavilion end from where he bowled a pretty consistent line without any luck. The slowness of the pitch was making life difficult for Ballinger's bowlers and although turning lots## too easy for the batters. Cadmore's Dutton batted well for his 96* but there were plenty of classic village green shots from the rest of the Ends batsmen.</p> <p>Ben Dugdale( 3-77) gave us a mixture of very good off-spin and ""buffet"" bowling## Tom McIntyre (2-47) bowled a really good spell of leg-spin at the death and Reece returned with another excellent spell ending with 3-47 off his 10 overs.</p> <p>We had two other new members of the the club playing in the game. Daren Samet## who## I think## enjoyed his re-introduction into the game## and U14 Connor Underwood who was asked to play at the last minute and became the teams 11th man. He did an excellent job in the field including taking a very good catch.</p> <p>Unfortunately the above can't hide the fact that Cadmore scored an impressive 242 -8</p> <p>Ballinger's pursuit of this was led by the skipper who opened with Max Dugdale. As often the case## over the next 39 overs it was the boys that did the job rather than the adults. Apart from an excellent first innings of the season from Paul Branigan ( 32) the bulk of Ballinger's reply was scored by the boys. Max Dugdale with 22 led the way followed by brother Ben with 33 and an excellent 29* from Jake Cutter.&nbsp;</p> <p>It almost looked like we could hang on for a draw but with 6 overs left Connor was run out and we finished on 162 -10.</p> <p>A long report for the first game but it was very enjoyable to get back on the pitch## the opposition were good value for their win as well as making it a pleasant afternoons cricket. They were also full of praise for Ballinger's juniors and for those interested yes it was a good tea.</p> <p>Happy Days</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2011-05-15
734,<p>The U12s first outing last night was the also the first of nine times that Ballinger will play The Lee at various ages including the senior sides.</p> <p>Frequently the quality of cricket shown at these meetings is distorted by the need for the win over local rivals or## in the case of the boys last night## bragging rights at school the following day.</p> <p>The Lee won the toss and elected to bat on what was a belter of a track. Tom Line and Max Hutt were soon into their stride punishing anything wayward but Will Arnold kept his line immaculately and his 4 overs cost a miserly 8 runs. Rob Farquhar was bowling well at the other end but the short boundary on the&nbsp;pavilion side meant anything remotely near the leg&nbsp;side was put away by The Lee openers.</p> <p>Having put on over 60 for the 1st wicket the introduction of Jamie Kingston removed both the openers in consecutive overs. This changed the whole complex of the game. Skipper McIntyre had taken a bit of pasting in his first 2 overs but he was quickly back to get his revenge. Some smart fielding and some senseless running between the wickets meant The Waggoners kept the visitors down to 94- 7&nbsp;in their 20 overs. Gethin Ross bowled well for his 4 overs and generally the fielding was OK with only 1 catch being dropped. Brandon Allen did another excellent job behind the stumps.</p> <p>Brandon then opened the batting with his skipper and they patiently gave Ballinger a decent start. Ollie Brown bowled very well&nbsp;keeping&nbsp;one end tied up but Charlie Boyd had lost his radar and the&nbsp;extras were keeping the scoreboard ticking over. Max Hutt and Robbie Birkett bowled well keeping Ballinger behind the run rate&nbsp;but the introduction&nbsp;of Tom Line produced the first wicket enticing Brandon to hit to mid-off. Unfortunately for The Lee this brought in Edward Eaton-Hart who set about the Lee bowlers with gusto. His 30 came up in only 28 balls including 4 x fours. This also encouraged his skipper to open up and they both ended up retiring within a couple of overs.</p> <p>Fortunately only 2 were required off the penultimate over and thanks to generosity of the Lee bowlers these were provided in extras as there was no guarantee that the batters would have managed it on their own.</p> <p>Another cold evening being frustrated by players who should know better but## a win is a win.</p> <p>Finally - something to ponder. If you put 5/6 of the boys from each team together you'd have had a very decent cricket team but## would they have had as much fun?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-05-18
801,"<p>This was never going to be an easy game and unfortunately## it lived up that billing.&nbsp;</p> <p>High Wycombe were ""awesome"" and delivered a barrage of boundaries against our bowlers## who toiled away with little luck. &nbsp;We had early success with Matt and Toby taking catches off James Mc and Seth - skipper turned to spin early and it got the result. however this brought in Saif## who plays for U15 county side and in 7 or 8 balls## scored 30 runs## 4 sixes## a 4 and two singles. HW were on 12 / over at one stage in the game. &nbsp; The batting which followed Saif was also good and they finished on 186. &nbsp;The figures are unkind on James Mc## who endured the worst of Saif's destructiveness and was bowling a reasonable line but dropping it a bit short. &nbsp;Greg caused the most problems with his suprising speed and accuracy. &nbsp; The fielding was not the best display with some of the boys letting their heads drop and making silly errors. &nbsp;</p> <p>Ballinger were never in the run chase## barely getting above 4 an over throughout the innings. &nbsp;Almost everyone who batted got some runs but no one built an innings. &nbsp;Hamish and Toby openned sensibly but got out trying to force the pace. &nbsp;Brandon looked good and got out to a super ball. &nbsp;Matt again looked confident before getting caught. &nbsp;James Mc and Ollie Cooksey had a useful partnership of 20 at the end.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2011-05-20
802,<p>This was the closest we have come to beating Gerrards Cross## who feature a number of county players. &nbsp;I was quite happy with Ballinger's performance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Gerrards Cross reached 100 with loss of only 3 wickets in the 12th over but we did not let our heads drop this time and restricted them to a more realistic target of 137. &nbsp; It would have been considerably lower had we held our catches - 4 dropped in total; this really was the difference between the teams. Otherwise the fielding was very good and full of energy and commitment. &nbsp;Pick of the bowlers were Freddie D-S with with 1-5 off 3 overs and Monty with 2-15 off 4 overs. &nbsp;Sam Peters also claimed 2 wickets in two overs. &nbsp; Brandon was excellent behind the stumps - a superb stumping and a catch. Andy Thomson also remarked that he probably should have given a run out to James Mc's incredible throw-down on the stumps from a fairly deep cover.</p> <p>Monty went early from a good diving catch from GX. &nbsp;Brandon looked in good nick but got run out. &nbsp;Freddie saw off the openners but did not capitalise. &nbsp;Hamish then stepped up and played a captains innings and really speeded up the run rate## retiring on 30. It was an important knock when we had lost some early wickets and were behind the chase. &nbsp; Oscar supported with good hitting. &nbsp;Greg lifted the team and gave some hope with some hard hitting## ending on 22 not out with 4 boundaries## supported by Sam Peters who scored 6 of 4 balls and Dom Brown. &nbsp;We did not quite get there but against this bowling attack## it was very good to get 120 runs and the team should be proud.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-05-20

855,<p>On Tuesday Ballinger hosted Chalfont St.Peter on another chilly night on the green.</p> <p>It's always difficult to decide who's made the major contributions in pairs cricket but one thing did stand out was the fielding.</p> <p>Chalfont batted first and reached 265 but only lost 5 wickets. There was the usual quota of extras but they were kept in check by some tight bowling from the likes of Harri Doyle and Alex Beneke. All did well though.</p> <p>When The Waggoners batted running berween the wickets was the main problem with 5 wickets falling to run outs. The final total of 284 was helped by the generosity of Chalfont's bowlers but James Gill gave the innings plenty of momentum with three fours in one over.

757,"<p>""All good things come to an end""## and Ballinger's fine start to the season was badly derailed at Knotty Green. A lost toss meant KG taking first knock on a fine sunny afternoon## and Ballinger's hopes of an early wicket were thwarted by some disappointingly inaccurate opening bowling - a total of 16 wides were conceded during the innings!The KG openers had amassed an untroubled 97 before the first wicket went down## but the scoring rate had fallen thanks to some tighter bowling## particularly by Ian Maciver## well supported by Jono Lacey. Carlton Siddle## doubtless furious with himself for having just dropped a sitter## then came on to take two wickets with successive deliveries## and suddenly KG were 149 for 5## in the 36th over## and&nbsp;Ballinger's prospects&nbsp;were starting to look rosy. However## their bowling## strong on paper## was weakened by both Andy Thompson and Ian Davies carrying injuries and&nbsp;thus unable to bowl## and KG then took control of the game with an unbroken century partnership for the 6th wicket in only 14 overs. Sixes flew out of the ground in all directions as the hapless bowlers toiled in vain. A final total of 253 for 5 was the outcome## and among the bowlers## only Ian Maciver's figures of 2 wickets for 31 in 12 overs will be recalled with pleasure.</p> <p>BWCC's reply never looked very convincing from the start. Both openers Paul Humphreys and Richard O'Kelly were out by the time 29 was on the board. Rollo resisted with 24## and skipper Davies batted fluently for 40## as did Carlton (29)## but 119 for 3 became 127 for 8 as the middle order imploded. An early night in the bar beckoned## but Jono Lacey and Jack Hankinson had other ideas. With a judicious mixture of assault (mostly## but not exclusively## Jono) and watchful defence (mostly Jack)## a partnership of 58 was achieved for the 9th wicket. Then Jono perished going for one 6 too many## but with only 5 overs left an improbable draw seemed possible. Alas## Nick Adams playing in out-of-character defensive mode fell to a catch## with only 14 possible deliveries left in the match## leaving Ballinger 195 all out.</p> <p>So## a respectable final total## but in reality Ballinger were outplayed by a stronger looking side.</p>",,2011-05-22

743,"<p>What a frustrating afternoon for the Waggoners.</p> <p>Having lost toss skipper Kerry was very surprised when his opposite number elected to bat on what was going to be a very slow wicket.</p> <p>With a howling gale blowing from one end it was decided that bowling Reece Tiley into it wasn't going to be an option so## it was our two senior professional who led the attack. Evan Webster down the hill and Bastie Richards in to the wind. For 14 overs these two kept Haddenham on the rack. Only 34 runs were scored with Evan being ridiculously unlucky not get a wicket in his first spell of 0-14 off 7 overs.</p> <p>Bastie faired a little better although his first wicket was a Fred Carno affair. A rubbish ball## a rubbish shot with the batter hitting it twice## once on the drive and the second time on his follow through. The whole episode was only saved by a brilliant catch by Tim Cutter. Bastie restored some order by bowling Haddenham's no 3 with with a jaffa.</p> <p>At this stage Haddenham were 34 -2. Unfortunately it was getting wet and miserable and the bowlers were finding it hard to grip the ball. I'm not sure this wholly excused the 48 extras we gave away - ""keeper Branigan senior was at pains to insure we noted that there were only 3 byes - but it did make it easier for Haddenham to use there favourite shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>The skipper wasn't sure he'd ever had 2 fielders at ""cow corner"" for all bar 10 overs of an innings.An 8-3 field would give a general idea of where the ball was going.</p> <p>Jake bowled OK for his 6-2-21 but Evan was the pick when he returned and took 3-18 in his last spell.</p> <p>206 - 9 was 60 more than the skipper wanted to chase but the Winning draw was only 183.1111 runs away.Haddenham opener Linke batted well for his 51 but frankly the hosts should have been out for around 140</p> <p>Will Smith and Monty Thompson led off the chase and although a measured start it wasn't going to be quick enough for us to chase down 206. Monty's demise meant Bastie was able to mix a few lusty blows with some &nbsp;elegant drives. Will was next to go but Paul Branigan was in a determined mood and was soon upping the pace.</p> <p>He and Bastie put on 57 in only 8 overs before Paul was given out LBW. Best to ask him about it. Bastie then for some reason known only to him took a huge swipe and was bowled. Darren Samat and Jake Cutter were now together and they took the score past various batting point markers until it was realised we could reach the magic 184 for a winning draw.</p> <p>Suddenly the field was spread## the umpires decisions being scrutinised## the scorers being carefully monitored and every run cheered and clapped - so we could keep warm.</p> <p>11 off the last over was a tall order but when Jake hit the first ball for 4 the equation changed. A single## a two## another single## four off two balls## could they do it? well you know now that## sadly## the two Waggoners couldn't quite manage it## failing by 1.1 runs to beat the require target.</p> <p>The difference between the extras given away by the two sides was 17 in favour of Haddenham. This would have put us in contention to win the game let alone the winning draw so it was a frustrating afternoon for the Waggoners.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2011-05-29

&quot;Candara&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">Monday evening`s game was like playing on a North Sea oil rig. The boys didn`t seem to mind though and the visitors elected to bat first. A good start saw James Reid take the first wicket bowling Habeeb for 7. A superb batting performance by Matt Haumann, who went on to score 56 not out later, pushed Beaconsfield on to 71 before Captain James Fray tempted a catch taken by Dylan Shellard. Ballinger slowed down a poor middle order taking 5 more wickets for 39 runs.&nbsp; Henry Turrell put in a solid 30 runs retired, Rufus SW batted to 14 before a tough LBW decision and Dan Adams with a useful 15 gave Ballinger 117 on 20 overs. A good performance by the aforementioned Matt H secured a victory for Beaconsfield on a fearfully cold night on the common. All down to a top batsman doing his job!

758,<p>Last week's result was disappointing. This week's was downright depressing. The only success that came Ballinger's way was winning the toss. Their batsmen were then unable to cope with an accurate WESM attack. Too keen to chase runs on what they thought would be a good batting track## five of the first six were out to catches## and only Andy Thompson's hour-long knock of 23 showed what grit and determination could achieve. All out for 116 in only 33 overs was a pretty pathetic total## and one that was never going to worry WESM## who had knocked off 48 of them without loss by the tea interval. It only took them a further 11 overs to overhaul Ballinger's meagre target## a stroll in the park against a bowling attack that looked about as competent as the batsmen had.</p>,,2011-05-30
843,<p>Ballinger Under 17s won a thrilling match against Taplow. Batting first Will Smith and Sebastian Richards put on an opening partnership of 51 runs off just 6 overs before Sebastian was bowled for a well made 19. Harry Bartlett was bowled by a superb delivery but Will was then well supported by sensible middle order batting contributed by Jack Bull## Jamie Wise and Tom Edmonds.Will Smith's innings of 76 not out was as good a performance as any he has made for Ballinger and he is maturing into a fine batsman.</p> <p>Taplow batted after the break and were immediately restricted in the search for runs by a superb opening spell from Hamish Sim## 3 overs yielding 1 wicket&nbsp;for just 14 runs. Jake Cutter opened with spin from the other end and his figures of 1 for 18 off 4 overs do not do full justice to a superb piece of bowling. The opening&nbsp; bowlers were well supported with another fine display from Evan Webster and also from young Monty Thompson.</p> <p>Taplow however were a formidable batting side and at 92 for&nbsp;3 were edging ahead. Will turned to Harry Bartlett and Harry Rix to close the innings out and how well they bowled## showing real maturity in a difficult situation. Harry Bartlett returned figures of 3 wickets for 14 off 3 overs and Harry Rix had figures of 3 for 19 off 3 overs.</p> <p>Ballinger 131 for 6 off 20 overs.</p> <p>Taplow 125 for 8 off 20 overs</p> <p>The match went to the last over with Ballinger winning by 6 runs. Well done to all the boys.</p>,,2011-06-01

760,<p>Ballinger arrived at league leaders Holmer Green feeling that after last week's shambles things must surely improve. And improve they did. Ian Davies won the toss (he's getting good at it - maybe it's that knack that bankers have with money?) and perhaps apprehensive of the reputation of HG's pace attack on a hard## fast looking pitch## decided to field first. HG were soon scoring fast## boundaries flying across a lightning fast outfield. But the fates (and the umpires) were smiling on Ballinger. Wickets kept falling## sometimes fortuitously## sometimes brilliantly ( a catch by Danny Draper## a slick stumping by Richard O'Kelly). Almost unbelievably seven wickets were in the bag for a paltry 107## and only 22 overs gone. Could this be Ballinger's day? No## the HG tailenders decided. With sensible application## the eigth wicket pair put on 37## then the ninth wicket 61## as Ballinger fretted and fumed. The bowling was mostly steady## and the fielding## mostly## good## but the fates had evidently decided they had smiled on Ballinger for long enough. Still## a total of 213 should be easily attainable by Ballinger's power-packed batting line-up. Shouldn't it ??</p> <p>All went well in the awkward one over Ballinger had to face before tea## as the whirlwind Steve Jermain opened with three consecutive wides at Andy Thompson. But ten minutes after the resumption## Andy aimed a slightly less than well executed hook## and departed caught. Meanwhile Richard O'Kelly looked in absolutely prime form## although Ian Davies looked rather the opposite.. Davies was clean bowled with total on 50. Richard and Paul Humphreys raised it to 65 before Paul## evidently also out of touch## decided to offer no shot## and saw his bails trimmed. Incredible as it is to relate## the scoreboard that had stood at 65 for 2## with 17 overs gone## was reduced to 67 all out in the space of 6 more overs## courtesy of change bowlers D Little and D King## who were simply too fast and too straight for Ballinger's hapless batsmen. Richard's superb knock of 52## with 6 extras## meant that the remaining 10 batsmen contributed precisely 9 runs between them. 7 batsmen were clean bowled## three got golden ducks - one of them## Jamie Kellock## having actually avoided being bowled first ball## wandered down the wicket in the process(possibly inspecting it with his groundsman's eye?)## and rather forgot that he needed to ground his bat before the wicketkeeper removed his bails.</p> <p>All of which goes to show why Ballinger are likely to spend an anxious season in the lower reaches of the league## and why Holmer Green are deservedly setting the pace. Perhaps it is cruel that they achieved their victory with their most prolific batsman away on holiday... Nevermind## Ballinger's performance in the field was much more encouraging. As for the batsmen## nets anybody?</p>,,2011-06-04
803,<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Following on from the excellent (losing performance to Gerrards Cross) and a reasonable performance against Chesham## on paper## this game looked like ours to lose.</p> <p>Our side was missing our two openners who have been scoring well this season## but we have depth now in the squad and I felt that we should still be able to beat Great Kingshill.</p> <p>We batted first## started quite well and then slowed to a smail's pace## scoring just 5 runs of 5 overs leaving with us only 25 off the first 9 overs. &nbsp;The opposition bowling was very tight and there was some home advantage playing on a very bouncey all-weather pitch.</p> <p>The top order (Hamish (15)## Brandon(14)## James Mc all tried to force the pace and got out accordingly). &nbsp;Brandon's innings was patient but he struggled to find the gap. &nbsp;Dom brown scored a quicker 12 off 12 balls and the run rate drifted up to 3 per over. &nbsp;It was Reece's contribution of 26 from 16 balls and Matthew O'Kelly scoring 12 off just 4 balls (hitting the hardest four of the season) which meant that we able to score 44 runs off the last 5 overs. There was something for the the bowlers to have a go at but it was never going to be enough.</p> <p>Our bowling and fielding was tight - Gt Kingshill on only 38 from the first 10 overs - but the wickets were not falling. &nbsp;Reece was the pick of the bolwers with just 12 off his 4. &nbsp;James Mc gave some hope bowling number 4 out for zero## quickly followed by William getting out their no.4 for just 3 runs. &nbsp;The youngsters## Fred and Edward were very effective in the field but our score was never high enough and they reached it with some hard hitting from their number 5 Pistana with 10 balls to spare.</p> <p>Reece - man of the match</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-05
844,<p>If 48 hours is a long time in politics then so it&nbsp; also is with cricket. Ballinger Under 17s returning fresh from their victory earlier in the week returned to the home ground to play Great Kingshill in the cup.</p> <p>Great Kingshill won the toss and batted sensibly to score 120 runs for the loss of 7 wickets## well contained by Ballinger with all the bowlers contributing## and it was&nbsp;good to see Joe Hankinson back &nbsp;leading the attack.</p> <p>Highlights were the bowling of Monty Thompson## 2 wickets for 17 runs## Jake Cutter 1 wicket for 11 runs and Reece Tiley with 1 wicket for 12 runs## well supported by an excellent spell from Harry Rix## 0 for 17 off 4 overs## Geoerge Kingston&nbsp; 0 for 17 off 3 overs and Sebastian Richards 1 for 14 off 2 overs.</p> <p>Ballinger approached the run chase in a strangely diffident manner losing 6 wickets for 12 runs as each batsman became pinned down by some excellent Great Kingshill bowling.</p> <p>Enter Jake Cutter to join Jamie Wise as they led the Ballinger fight back before Jamie was out for 8. Harry Rix continued to support Jake before being bowled. Now George Kingston entered the fray to join Jake Cutter. Jake was now sending balls all round the pitch as he tore into the bowling attack and the partnership with George Kingston led Ballinger to needing 20 runs from the last 2 overs. Sadly Jake was out caught## having contributed a&nbsp;superb innings of 55 ## which showed real character.</p> <p>George Kingston continued to play his shots## finishing on 18 not out but unfortunately the last two partnerships left Ballinger just 6 runs short of victory .The final score being&nbsp; 115 runs for the loss of 9 wickets## nonetheless a spirited fightback by the team.</p> <p>Great Kingshill 120 for 7 off 20 overs</p> <p>Ballinger 115 for 9 off 20 overs</p> <p>Great Kingshill won by 5 runs.</p>,,2011-06-05
868,<p>Electing to bat first##&nbsp;Henry Turrell (30) and Matt O'Kelly (21) set the pace of the innings with a fine 49 run partnership. &nbsp;Monty scored a good 30 retired albeit at a slower rate (40 balls). &nbsp;U12 Edward Eaton-Hart contributed with 12 off 12 balls with Greg ratcheting up the pace with 12 of 9 balls to get us to a repectable 128. &nbsp;Given that we were on 68 for 1 off 10 overs## I was hoping for Ballinger to post a huge score## still this was always going to be enough even without 3 of our usual bowlers.</p> <p>James Mc (1-7 off 4 overs) and Monty Thompson (2-13) were the pick of the bowlers. &nbsp;Hamish also bolwed tightly (1-14). &nbsp;Fielding was in general very good with 3 run-outs and 2 catches. &nbsp;The opposition never really managed to get close to the run rate required.</p> <p>Onto round 3.</p>,,2011-06-06
869,<p>The highlight of this rather one-sided game was Reece Tiley's amazing spell of 5 wickets (all bowled) for 2 runs of just 2 overs. Had Monty (skipper) decided to let Reece continue## I have little doubt that we would have restricted the opposition to a much lower score than the 33 that they did manage to post. &nbsp;Getting their top 3 out for just 4 runs surprised them - as I understand it from their coach## these 3 were used to scoring 30s. &nbsp; Denison-Smith and Brown also contributed with 2 wickets a piece and the fielding was generally tight## although we gave away too many wides; extra's contributed 14 of the 33 runs.</p> <p>Farnham Royal bowling was much more impressive than their batting but after losing a couple of early wickets## Greg and Toby saw us home with Greg scroring a reasonably quick 14 not out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Onto the quarter finals....against High Wycombe!</p>,,2011-06-06
744,<p>For the first time this summer Ballinger's selectors were called into play and their first move was to replace the skipper.</p> <p>Paul Branigan took on the mantle for the day and managed to continue the good work of the previous incumbent by losing the toss. Much to his amazement the visitors put the Waagoners into bat.</p> <p>For some reason Paul then handed over the setting of the batting order to the umpire - bad move.</p> <p>When Tom McInyre and Monty Thompson strolled out to the middle there was some discussion as whether this was the youngest ever opening partnership to represent the club. They may have been young in years but their approach to the task was very mature.</p> <p>For the first 20 overs they kept the rate at a very respectable 4 an over## against some very tight Prestwood bowling&nbsp;but## on another belter of a pitch## this was never going to be enough. After drinks they then put the 'pedal to the metal' and raced along at 7 an over until Monty was finally defeated for a well crafted 36 with the total on 161. As often is the case with one wicket comes two and Tom was out two overs later for a brilliant 95.</p> <p>Bastie joined Kim Hughes with both looking to increase the run rate further. Both perished in the attempt but Max Dugdale had joined the fray and## from the off## set about the Prestwood bowlers with great gusto. With Bastie and then the skipper he helped add 89 in only 10 overs of which he scored a brilliant 66*.</p> <p>The skipper## in conversation with that umpire again## had decided that a minimum of 240 by 42nd over was required so to reach 271 - 4 was riches indeed.</p> <p>After an excellent tea it was the bowlers turn to show how it should be done. Unfortunately Tom Graham's warm up game wasn't ideal preperation for the cut and thrust of the MBL and after only 5 overs the skipper had to remove his main strike force from the attack. At the other end Evan wasn't fairing much better. There was a strong breeze blowing across the ground and the amount of wind resistance Evan currently sports was making it difficult for him to make any headway.</p> <p>The combination of a left/right opening partnership for the visitors## some wayward bowling and a track that still refused to deteriorate meant much head scratching for the skipper. Whilst this was going on the visitors were quietly ticking along at near the required run rate to win the game.</p> <p>Finally## Tom Sperring(2-34) in his first game of the season and Bastie( 1-30) gave the skipper a measure of control. Tom removed KInsman with a jaffa then Bastie had danger man Greeves(51) well caught behind by Max.</p> <p>After that only Sanders(50) for the visitors offered any danger with the run rate slowly creeping towards the 10 an over mark. Jake Cutter did his best to keep Prestwood in the hunt but finally M of M Tom Mcintyre was brought into the attack and almost bowled the Waggoners to victory with 3 wickets in 5 overs. Prestwood finished on 222-8</p> <p>A couple of early chances went begging but generally this was a good all-round performance by the team.</p> <p>A lovely afternoon## an excellent track## two teams playing the game in the correct way## a proper umpire## a delicious tea and 21 points. Perfect</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-06

804,<p>Another game against Chesham in which we manage to get ourselves into a potentially winning position and lose it. &nbsp;With Chesham on 62 for 6 off 12 overs## Ballinger were contemplating chasing down a manageable target. &nbsp;Reece was once again the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 14 of his 4 overs. &nbsp;Hamish (1-13) and Freddie (2-16) were also bowling well in support## but there were a lot of wides and byes. &nbsp;Toby had a good day with the gloves## the bowlers were making life very difficult spraying the ball down the leg side coming off the slope and running down for several 4 byes; if you removed 20 byes / wides from the first 12 overs## we would have had Chesham on 42-6 off 12 overs and I suspect that might have created a very different result. Chesham went on to score 73 off their last 8 overs## which was a killer.</p> <p>Chesham bowling was excellent - particularly from ex Ballinger boy## Theo reynolds who bowled on the stumps 85% of his balls - all on a length and Freddie and Monty struggled to get the ball away. &nbsp;The run chase was never really on; our best position being 51-2 off 12 overs. &nbsp;Freddie anchored the innings and although he might have appeared slow## he scored his 25 in 28 balls - respectable against this bowling attack. &nbsp;We were let down by unneceesary run-outs - two from the non striker backing up too far and Monty lost his wicket wandering around the crease. &nbsp;Matt looked again to be in fine form but got himself run-out as did Reece who started with intent. &nbsp;The lower order played sensible cricket keeping the run-rate ticking along at around 5-6 / over. &nbsp;Henry Turrell helped this cause by scoring 16 off 10 balls. &nbsp;</p> <p>As in the last game against Chesham## the big difference was extras## had we matched their tally## we would have been within 10 runs of their total and with that as a target## maybe the result would have been different.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-08
794,<p>Sincere apologies from the Chesham manager. The match didn`t appear on the Chesham fixture list.

761,"<p>For once## skipper Davies lost the toss## but was far from unhappy that Ley Hill opted to bat first on a wicket softened by overnight rain. Their openers started at a funereal pace (reminiscent of Ballinger in the past?) and had only 15 on the board when Jack Hankinson struck## scattering the stumps with the first and fourth balls of his 5th over. Worse was to follow for Ley Hill when Nick Adams## having narrowly failed to reach the rebound from a valiant caught &amp; bowled attempt## then suffered the indignity of being hit for a towering 6## clung on to an even better caught &amp; bowled off the last ball of his 7th over. 36 for 3## and Ballinger's tails were up. Alas## Messrs Lown and Clarke (57) had other ideas and put on 89 for the 4th wicket. Ballinger's team was## with one teenage exception## exclusively composed of over 40's (some significantly over!)## yet their fielding belied this statistic. Some scintillating catches were taken## notably by Andy Thompson and Ian Davies## as Ley Hill battled their way to a respectable final score of 208## all out off the first ball of the 45th over. Jack Hankinson (4 for 33 in his 9 overs) was the star bowler## with Andy Thompson ( 4 for 59 off 12) close behind.</p> <p>Ballinger needed a good start. They didn't get one## as Matt Riley departed bowled in the second over. However## Richard O'Kelly was joined by Rollo McIntyre## and with both batsmen in top form from the previous weekend## the required run-rate was easily achieved. Rollo even had the temerity to smite the first ball he faced for 6. Unfortunately he perished LBW for 35 with the total on 62## whereupon although Richard continued in prime form giving a batting master-class## the other batsmen decided that a bit of hara-kiri was called for. Ian ""Pietersen"" Davies did his best to run himself and his partner out## and Paul Humphreys went one better## and succeeded. At 140 for 6## the match was now very much in the balance## with Richard perishing for a superb 74. Enter Messrs Hunting and Kellock## whose enterprising stand of 48 for the 7th wicket decisively swung the match in Ballinger's favour. But they both fell to catches## and with the total on 198## eleven runs were needed from the last two overs## and only two wickets left. Breathtaking stuff## but the cool head of Ian Maciver prevailed## and Ballinger eased home with three balls to spare!</p> <p>Maximum points (at last!) for BWCC## but perhaps the best thing was the sight of such a closely contested match going to the wire. Congratulations to both teams.</p>",,2011-06-12
745,<p>The seconds made the short trip to Bellingdon on Saturday to play Ley Hill.</p> <p>Skipper Kerry continued his&nbsp;consistent run of form with the toss by losing it once again. Once more he was surprised by the choice of the home skipper to bat. The 45/40 over split makes it a bit more of a tactical decision than the Waggoners skipper obviously appreciates.</p> <p>The wicket was very well grassed so there should have been some movement for the seam bowlers so the skipper wasn't too concerned about bowling first. Unfortunately the toss was the least of his problems. Not reading his emails properly and a senior pro doing like wise meant starting with only 9 players. Within half an hour though we obviously had 12.</p> <p>Evan Webster( 0-31)&nbsp;and Will Reid ( 2-33)&nbsp;opened up for the Waggoners and after their alotted 12 overs they had kept the score to a miserly 31 runs&nbsp;with Will&nbsp;taking 1 wicket from a good catch behind by Max Dugdale. Then it was time for the spin kings Rob Rose ( 1-51)&nbsp;and Bastie Richards ( 1-47). Rob struck first getting Ley Hill's No3 well caught by Will. Bastie was then unlucky to see the skipper drop his opposite number off an absolute dolly. Fortunately Kerry made up for it by catching the same player off a far more difficult chance. The boys both bowled well though Rob in particular started to tire towards the end and the skipper probably kept him on an over too long</p> <p>The Hill opener Lyne was batting well but## to the visitors## it appeared very slowly so they were happy to keep him in. He was finally out in the 40th over for 86. He was brilliantly caught by Darren Samat on the square leg boundary off recently introduced Ben Dugdale ( 3-21).&nbsp;Joe Batt for the home side added some aggression in his well played innings of 40 but he was caught by Max off his brother. Rob Rose taking the last catch again off Ben.</p> <p>The Hill finished on 187-7. It was difficult to work out how good a score that was on a slow wicket but even bounce.</p> <p>The visitors innings got off to a disastrous start with Keith Turnball being bowled first ball. I know he wanted to get away promptly but that's ridiculous. Rob McIntyre now joined Max and they tiggled along at just around the 4 an over that would give Ballinger the winning draw.</p> <p>Max(17) was first to go with the score on 47 with Rob (31)&nbsp;following 12 runs later. This brought Bastie and Paul Branigan together. Paul was soon into his stride and upped the run rate to match that required for a win. In 10 overs they added 65 before Bastie(15) was bowled going for one big hit too many. Darrren and Paul then added a rapid 29 before both were out within 4 runs of each other. Paul for an excellent 64 and Darren for a rapid 15 leaving 19 for the skipper and Ben Dugdale to score to claim the victory. They managed this without too much fuss with a couple of overs to spare.</p> <p>A very enjoyable game as always played in the right way. The pinic supplied by Mr.Partington was excellent but I suggest when they come to our place we lock up the tea bags.</p>,,2011-06-13
739,<p>Ballinger won a really exciting game at Kingshill on Thursday night with the win coming off the final ball.</p> <p>Kingshill batted first and the Waggoners struck early with Rob Farquhar claiming the first wicket. At the other end Will Arnold was bowling superbly without any luck. An excellent stand of 39 between Fountain and Webb seemed to have given Kingshill the initiative but the introduction of Jamie Kingston sooned changed that. His 3 for 10 in 4 overs put Ballinger frimly in control. A couple of wickets from Fred Sanders and with Will Arnold getting his just rewards with his second spell ending with 2-8 in his 4 overs meant the Waggoners were chasing a modest total.</p> <p>Huge credit for keeping Kingshill to 82-9 in their 20 overs must go to Gethin Ross who did a brilliant job of keeping wicket and only conceded 6 byes.</p> <p>Rob&nbsp;and Gethin opened up for the Waggoners but## unfortunately## Rob got a dose of his own treatment and was out in the first over. Sadly he was joined by Fred Peck and Fred Sanders in the same over. This meant Ballinger were 4 for 3 and in disarray.</p> <p>Oli Moir joined Gethin and finally some order was restored. They added 29 with some excellent shots## interesting running between the wickets and some good fortune. When Gethin was out for 17## Oli then added 18 with Finn Hynes and 15 with Will Arnold. When Will was out it was obvous it was going to be a tight finish with only 17 needed off 4 overs but only Oli as a recognised batsman left. Louis Kelmsley came and went&nbsp;then John Collier strode to the wicket. With calm assurance he and Oli guided the visitors home. Although the coach felt that leaving it to the last ball was a bit unnecesary.</p> <p>An enjoyable game played in the right spirit but not a good one for the coach's nerves.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-15
777,<p>Batting first Ballinger piled on the runs to make 131-4. Max opened the innings and once again played a big innings with 38. This included an excellent partnership of 57 for the second wicket with Ben (28) which was the foundation for a big score enabling the batsmen to be very attacking later in the innings. Josh Richardson made a quick-fire 21 batting at 4 that maintained the tempo. When Chalfont St Peter batted they found it hard to get going against some tight bowling and sharp fielding by Ballinger. The opening partnership was broken when Freddie swooped on the ball at midwicket## turned and threw sharply to Max for a run out - definitely the champagne moment. Mahmood's bowling was devastating with 3-2 off three overs including two maidens. Everyone else chipped in and a&nbsp;strong all round performance saw the U14s outplay Chalfont in all areas of the game.&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-15
863,<p>Ballinger got a pasting at Chartridge on Wednesday from a very decent Chesham side.</p> <p>Chesham batted first and on a cold night the bowling of Will Arnold was enough to warm the soul if not the body. Time and again he beat the bat with no luck. Finally he cleaned up fellow district player Milo Skelton. At the other end Rob Farquhar was proving less accurate with the left handed Jamie Franks causing him a few directional problems.</p> <p>The introduction of Oli Moir led to some interesting cricket. Thanks to two really good catches by Rob and another by Fred Sanders## Oli reduced Chesham to 49-5. Unfortunately at the same time he was giving away wides at a unacceptable pace.</p> <p>The introduction of spin helped Chesham get away with Manav and Fred both conceding 20 runs off their two overs. Add 27 extras to the the batting total and Chesham ended with a far to healthy 149 - 8. Once again Gethin did an excellent job behind the sticks conceding only 6 byes but 16 wides and 5 no balls is not good enough at this level. Pick of the bowlers was Will with 1-18 off his 4 overs.</p> <p>Not sure what to say about the batting. Apart from Will and Oli## who both batted well## no other player got into double figures. Chesham have a strong bowling line up but felt we should have scored more than the 69 we finally managed.</p> <p>It was a very cold evening and one I'll be pleased to forget</p>,,2011-06-15

857,<p>Ballinger played Beaconsfield on Thursday and in the end won comfortably.</p> <p>Batting first Ballinger set off at a break neck pace with Rory Bland and Jamie Fulcher running everything and smashing the ball to all parts. They scored 42 in only 3.2 overs before Rory was out for 15. Danny Simpson then continued the run fest with Jamie and after only 6 overs the Waggoners had 60 on the board. Then Jamie was out&nbsp;and the wheels fell off.</p> <p>The next four batters all fell for ducks and it wasn't until Ben Westland entered the fray did Ballinger finally get the total their start deserved. Ben's 31* plus 47 extras helped take the home team up to 128.</p> <p>Ballinger's bowling was steady with all the outfielders having a go whilst skipper Kit Reynolds performed heroics behind the stumps to ensure that not too many extras were given away. Unfortunately he couldn't help prevent the Waggoners donating 36 to the visitors score.</p> <p>Fortunately 128 always looked beyong Beaconsfield and their final total of 90 - 10 was a fair reflection of Ballinger's dominance.</p> <p>Ballinger's fielding was top draw with 2 very good run outs adding to some generally good ground fielding.</p> <p>An enjoyable game played in the right spirit. Well done to all</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-15
786,<p>Having suffered a defeat last week against Gerrards Cross## the boys were determined to reduce the number of wickets lost. We were struggling for numbers due to a clash with a paintballing party and were well aware of Chesham's high-scoring matches so far in the season## so we knew it was going to be tough. We were one player short in the end## due to a last minute illness.</p> <p>The scoreboard started sliding backwards## losing 5 wickets in the first 6 overs against some very accurate bowling from Chesham. Unlike the last match## they didn't lose their heads this time## with some good performances## particularly from the last two pairs of batsmen. Charlie B and Louis began to pick up the run rate again## as the middle pair## and James A and Henry K sensibly reducing the number of wickets taken. The last pair (brothers Monty and Theo) scored some great runs and really put the pressure on the fielding side. The final score for BWCC batting: 244 (9 wickets)</p> <p>Top batsmen: Monty 22## Theo 7## James Arnold 7 (no wickets lost)</p> <p>Monty kept wicket for the match## with only 1 bye creeping past him## but quickly secured two quick stumpings (b. Theo) in one over to really reduce Chesham's run-rate. Great catch by Henry again at mid-off (b. Dylan); and accurate bowling from Henry K &amp; James A earned them a wicket each. Chesham's final score 265 (6 wickets).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Although we lost by 21 runs## I was really pleased with the boys' performance at this match. Even though they were 1 man short in the field## they continued to work hard as a team## and kept Chesham's lead well below what they normally scored. Well done boys - I was really proud of you all. &nbsp;(Wendy Hutson)</p>,,2011-06-15

Some erratic bowling from HWCC - they took 10 wickets## but gave away 44 runs in wides and no-balls. Top batsmen: Monty 26-0; Henry K 7-0. BWCC final score: 245 for 10</p> <p>Our bowling and fielding started off better## with a guest appearance from Raphael W (age 6) who showed us all how well he can bowl already!! The fielding began to drift## with too many byes and a lack of back-up behind the wicket-keeper. HWCC's score continued upwards## and we could not take enough wickets to keep their score down. HWCC final score: 279 for 4. Top bowler: Henry K 2 wickets; James Bunce and Philip Sharkey taking the other 2.</p>,,2011-06-15

805,<p>The weather gods were siding with Ballinger. &nbsp;A game## scheduled for Wednesday which would have featured a full Wycombe side had to be rescheduled for Sunday## with Wycombe stripped of their county players. &nbsp;Ballinger was also missing 6 first choice players but were able to put together a decent side## who delivered a convincing league win - at last.&nbsp;</p> <p>Freddie won the toss and elected to bowl. &nbsp;Reece bowled with pace and accuracy and was unlucky not to take a wicket - finishing with just 7 runs off his 3 overs. The slow run rate## meant that Wycombe## who are used to scoring big## started taking risks - we missed a number of run out opportunities until Seth swooped onto the ball at close in square leg and ran out number 2. &nbsp; The tight bowliing from Monty and Reece induced their danger man## Jack Whelan into attempting a number of risky shots## until he was caught well by Toby off Sam's first over. &nbsp;It was a key wicket. &nbsp;Just as their number 4 looked like he was going to strike us all around the ground## Sam followed this with a good CAB running 2/3rds of the way down the pitch. &nbsp;Sam got their last dangerous looking batsman - clean bowled. &nbsp;Freddie bowled a tight line and length## finishing with 3-12 off 4 overs. James Reid bowled tightly (1-2-1) and Ollie N-M succeeded in bagging two wickets for 4 runs of 9 balls## including a diving CAB - Monty## time to eat some humble pie after some of the pre-match jybes aimed at Ollie.&nbsp;</p> <p>A special word for the keeping from Toby which was first class - only 2 byes## took some really difficult balls and was energetic and active behind the stumps. &nbsp;Also the bowling was much better. &nbsp;Extras down to just 8.</p> <p>Monty and Freddie openned and saw us home with a sensible approach to the low run rate required. &nbsp;Wycombe bowling was tight and apart from a few poorly called run attempts## they both batted well.</p> <p>Well done boys## - good performance which was really made by the very tight bowling and excellent keeping.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-19
762,"<p>Monks Risborough had covered their wicket overnight## but there still looked enough in it for Ian Maciver to opt to bowl first. Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson opened proceedings steadily## and the scoring was slow## partially due to a wet outfield sporting a colourful crop of buttercups. Opening bat Amjad (52) must have thought it was his birthday as he profited from a succession of near misses when Ballinger fielders failed to hang on to (mostly) difficult catches. Sunshine gave way to a series of heavy showers - through which both sides bravely battled on. A superb diving catch by Rhodri Webster and a&nbsp;quick-thinking stumping by Richard O'Kelly redeemed Ballinger in the fielding department## and then Carlton Siddle## returning after a three week absence## showed how important he is to the side with a fine spell of bowling - 6 for 42 off 10 overs. However## Monks' total of 164 looked a competitive score## especially as a particularly heavy shower coinciding wiith the tea interval had spiced up the wicket.</p> <p>Ballinger made a steady start through openers Richard O'Kelly and Rhodri Webster## and had put on 52 before Richard## trying to force the pace## was caught for 31. The showers returned## the temperature dropped## and the outfield became even slower. Where Monks' batsmen had scored threes## now similar shots were only going for two. Rollo McIntyre enlivened proceedings (as usual) but once he had gone for 24## wickets started to tumble as the batsmen tried ever harder to keep up with the necessary run rate. Rhodri went for a watchful 39## fifth out with the total on 112.## then as the ""heavy guns"" of Nick Adams and Jeremy Hunting both perished early&nbsp;in the cause of quick runs## it was left to Andy Thompson (15 not out) and Ian Maciver to shut up shop and secure a (losing) draw. By this time the pitch was starting to resemble a quagmire## the rain was pouring down again## and both teams were glad to get off the field. If only there had been a pavilion in which to shelter and change!</p>",,2011-06-20
871,<p>After putting Little Marlow into bat first## Waggoners struggled to contain Marlow openers Ali and Cox## who put on 59 between them. This gave the hosts a solid start and although Ballinger slowed them up## some steady batting took the home side to 144## a respectable score for 20 overs on a long boundary pitch. Highlights were a superb 3 over spell by Ollie and a couple of great catches by Sam.</p> <p>Ballinger started disasterously## after the normally super-dependable Gethin Ross was bowled out for a duck after facing only 3 balls. Rob and Sam steadied the ship though putting together an 80 partnership which gave the B`s some hope## and at the half-way point they were only 7 runs behind the target average. Somewhat of a batting collapse followed though## and a tight field restricted our boys to a total of 120## on a long but pleasant evening.</p> <p>Our man of the match - Sam Peters.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-21

Ian was scoring in style and managed to find the boundaries with ease## despite the slow outfield. Upon the dismissal of Fally## Ian was joined by Bastie who began to increase the run-rate## including a straight six that would have cleared any boundary. These two batsmen took the score past 150 before succumbing to some good bowling by the Rivetts openers## re-entering the frame and Ballinger finished on a respectable 173 when called in by Hunting. <br /><br />Ballinger came out keen (as ever) in the field and## with the weather clearing up## the omens looked promising as a good start followed.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>With the Hankinson brothers opening the line## a wicket in just the second over from a well taken catch by the hands of Fally gave Joe his first wicket.

With large boundaries and a good wicket it looked as if the spinners would do most of the damage and this prediction seemed correct as Stuart MacGowan took a wicket in his first over## caught in the covers## Jake Cutter proceeded to bowl from the other end## also taking a wicket in his first few balls. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>These two continued to bowl the next twelve overs with few runs coming off the bat and two well taken catches from Jack Hankinson coming off Jake&rsquo;s bowling.

Jake continued on with Ben Dugdale from the other end who## despite a few loose opening balls## ensued to bowl well## restricting the imperious Smitter who surpassed his half century in no time. Ben was denied a wicket as a result of some sloppy fielding including a few dropped catches and not even the quick thinking of his brother behind the stumps could dismiss the batsmen## ending the day with 6-0-32-0. However Jake received a lot more luck; Jack Hankinson holding another catch off a top-edge and Bastie making no mistake with his more simple effort leaving him with figures of 12-0-63-5.

763,<p>Skipper Davies## back on duty## for once failed to win the toss## and can't have been surprised when Downley invited Ballinger to bat first## as the pitch had endured a night's rain## and was therefore likely to be unpredictable. The start was unpromising## the first wicket falling at 15## when Rhodri Webster departed caught. Rollo joined Danny Draper## and they set about repairing the situation. A watchful partnership soon became a dominant one## with Danny (profiting from three dropped catches!) playing second fiddle to a rampant Rollo. They had put on 103 for the second wicket before a Downley fielder at last clung on to a Danny offering## and he departed for a valuable 40. Then came a dose of the Ballinger wobbles - not unknown when we have a strong-on-paper batting side. Richard O'Kelly and Matt Riley were gone in the blink of an eye## and suddenly the scoreboard read 130 for 4. Ian Davies joined Rollo## and they proceeded to put on 92 for the fifth wicket. The fact that Ian## batting well## managed to contribute a mere 18 of these illustrates the overwhelming dominance of Rollo## who mercilessly destroyed the Downley bowling on his way to superlative 145## including no fewer that 11 sixes and 11 fours! Magnificent stuff. We await the insurance claims....</p> <p>A final total of 247 for 8 at the end of 45 overs looked good enough to win most matches## but we have had plenty of problems with Downley in the past. A cool cloudy afternoon had now given way to breezy sunshine## and the pitch## never the problem it threatened## was now even easier. Enter the man who has swung so many matches Ballinger's way over the years - Nick Adams. To bowl the prolific Downley captain Cox with his very first ball ( a full toss## but doubless planned as a canny surprise) was a huge bonus.. But in his third over he excelled himself## with two wickets## clean bowled##&nbsp;off the first two balls. The hat trick ball looked plumb LBW (as the batsman later admitted it probably was) but was given not out. The batsman's respite was short-lived## as Nick then took a blinding caught &amp; bowled to make it&nbsp;a triple&nbsp;wicket maiden over## and. left Downley in utter disarray at 17 for 4. They recovered somewhat## but Ballinger were not to be denied. Nick took an even better catch## as Andy Thompson and Ian Maciver each bagged a couple of scalps## and Ian Davies wrapped up the innings with a wicket in the 36th over## to leave Downley 135 all out.</p> <p>A thoroughly admirable victory## celebrated in customary style in the Old Swan afterwards## as the jugs kept appearing! Maximum points too - much needed## just a shame we lost out by not providing an umpire for the first time this season.</p>,,2011-06-25
790,"<p>Simon Carlin captained today's match&nbsp;- a very exciting&nbsp;game played in brilliant sunshine for a change!! Having won the toss## he elected to field first.</p> <p>The Ballinger boys## having generally had a very accurate season on the bowling front## let it slip badly in today's match. 52 runs were conceded in extras (oops!)## but Hugo did a stirling job as wicket-keeper## with only 2 byes. James Larard took 2 wickets and Henry King## Simon Carlin## James Arnold &amp; Will Hardman each took 1 wicket. Energy on the field was also definitely lacking.</p> <p>Having had a ""few words"" in the changing room## the boys took the criticism well## and lifted their game## knowing that they would lose their 2nd position in the Bucks league if they didn't.</p> <p>The Waggoners&nbsp;batted steadily and well## and didn't let the first two wickets dampen their enthusiasm or fluster them. Each pair came out## ready to face some very good bowling from Chalfont St Giles## and I saw some of the best shots played this season! &nbsp;Simon Carlin was top batsman today## scoring 23 ( 4 fours !!) - some classic shots## and continually looking for the gaps in the field. Charlie Barraclough scored 14## but lost a wicket.</p> <p>The match still had all to play for as the last pair came in to bat - it could still easily go either way. Louis Thomson and Matthew Barton faced some fast and very accurate bowling - although no runs were scored off the bat## they took advantage of a couple of byes## and defended their wickets well## not risking anything against determinded Ch St G fielders.</p> <p>BWCC finished on 275 (against 261)## so winning the match by 14 runs !!! Well done boys.</p> <p>Keep your eye on the Bucks league tables - (update done## but not yet showing) Will we retain 2nd place in the league## or will Gerrards X snatch our position - still all to be played for in the final game!! &nbsp;(Wendy Hutson)</p>",,2011-06-26
860,<p>We travelled to Chalfont St Peter on Thursday and had a very enjoyable evening considering the coach didn't have a team at 8.00am in the morning. His thanks goes out to all those mums&nbsp;who helped make it happen.</p> <p>Chalfont batted first and when the skipper Kit was told Ballinger&nbsp;would have to take the field with only 10 players again## he was completely unconcerned and had already organised the bowling order etc.</p> <p>I would like to say that the Waggoners were like a well oiled machine but that would be a bit of an exaggeration. 24 extras does give the batting side a bit of help but the boys fielded well and took most of the catches offered and the ones missed would have been 'top draw' if taken. A special mention must go to James Gill whos 3 overs cost 1 run plus a wicket and he took a good catch and almost took a blinder.</p> <p>I could mention all the bowlers but look at the stats and you'll see that they all did well whilst keeping the home side down to 69 in their 20 overs</p> <p>Simon Carlin and Ben Westland opened up for the Waggoners. Ben's innings was cruelly cut short when he played on but Simon was in imperious form. Charlie Barraclogh and Simon added 34 before Simon was out for a very well played 17. Charlie then added 22 with Ollie Hardman and## when Ollie was out for 8. watched the opposition bowl us home with a series of wides.</p> <p>Well done to all but especially to Kit for running the game so well.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-06-27
818,Ballinger travelled to Taplow unsure of what to expect. Would the wicket be fit for play? Would we actually have 11 players? Thankfully the answer to both was yes. Taplow won the toss and opted to bat first on what looked a tired pitch. Despite an excellent opening spell from Jack Hankinson and Nick Tegg (yes we were short of bowling) Taplow cruised to an opening stand of 50 before Max Dugdale swooped on a quick single and threw the stumps down. Wickets tumbled at regular intervals but first team player Mills compiled an excellent 94 which enabled Taplow to declare at 243-9 after 43 overs. Wickets were shared between Jack Hankinson (2-40)## Fally (1-43)## S Richards (2-43)## Graham Salisbury (1-17) and W Smith (2-6). Ballingers reply started badly when Humphreys and Bunce departed with on 9 on the board. Fally and Will put on 66 before Fally went. Will continued as partners came and went and would have scored more if the boundaries hadnt been ridiculously huge. He was eventually out for an excellent 63 caught whilst trying to hit his elusive straight six on the boundary edge. Wickets kept falling but skipper Salisbury and Nick held out for an honourable draw. Good game,,2011-06-30
819,Ballinger entertained local club Missenden Misfits on Sunday on a cold day at Ballinger common. Having won the toss Ballinger elected to bat and lost Humphreys for 17 and Smith for 6. Riley continued in his normal style and with Fally and Hunting helped Ballinger declare at 225-6 at tea. Matt had by then scored an imperious 124 and should have broken the club record for the highest individual score. The Misfits reply was soon dented when Cutter removed opener Partridge with a vicious leg spinner that Shane Warne would have been proud of. Unfortunately Misfits made their intentions clear that we would have to work hard to bowl them out. Enter the old timer Stuart McGowan. With all of his experience he whittled through the batting order to finish with figures of 6-40. He was ably supported by the latest spin bowler to come out of the colts section Monty Thompson## fresh from his gargantuan tea to keep his energy up. Monty bowled exceptionally## especially against the left handers and finished things off with figures of 3-40.,,2011-06-30
821,Longwick arrived at the common on Sunday to be greeted by a cold windy day. Longwick won the toss and put Ballinger into bat hoping the new ball would produce a cluster of wickets. Openers Humphreys and Smith obviously had read the same game plan and proceeded to put on 88 for the first wicket before Paul fell LBW for 55. Will soon followed when he nicked one behind for 21 and walked from the crease before the umpire had a chance to put his finger up. Matt by now was into his stride and with Kellock (16) and Hunting (59 No) put on 150 runs for the next two wickets. Matt eventually fell for 62 trying to up the run rate. Nick then scored a quick fire 18 to allow Ballinger to declare on 261-4 at tea. The Longwick team left the field thinking they were well an truly out of the game. They soon realised they werent. Jono removed the number 1 bat for 4 but the next four batsmen added 160 runs at a decent rate and soon they thought they were in the game. Enter Jack Hankinson. In 14 hostile overs Jack picked up 5 wickets## either bowled or LBW. By now Longwick had decided that a draw was the best option and the bowlers were rotated trying to get the last 4 batsmen out. Jamie## Jake and Monty ( who again bowled exceptionally well and should have picked up more than the one wicket he ended with) all had a go but in the end we couldnt dislodge the number 11 batsman. A good game and a draw was most probably a fair result.,,2011-06-30
820,Ballingers Sunday jugernaught travelled to Bourne end on Sunday hoping to keep the winning ways going. Having won the toss skipper Salisbury decided to bat first on what looked an interesting pitch. Initial thoughts were soon proved correct as openers Humphreys and Smith were soon either fending the ball off their noses or trying to keep balls out that rolled along the ground. They put on 43 before Will gloved one off another ball that bounced more than it should of and then Paul then departed to the opposite when a ball pitched half way down and rolled along the floor for 42. Jeremy hung around for a good 32 and had good partnerships with Jack Hankinson (22) and Stuart (25) which took Ballinger to 184-9 at tea. Bourne Ends reply started badly when Jack clean bowled Duncombe for 1## smashing the middle stump in the process## and then had his fellow opener caught behind for 20. Evan ably supported Jack from the other end and removed the number 3 for a duck before the spin twins of McGowan and Cutter came on to spin their web and proceeded to take the next 5 wickets. The wickets were all shared round with jack and Jake taking two each and Stuart and Evan 3 each bowling Bourne out for 120 A good game but not the sort of pitch we should play on too often##,,2011-06-30
822,Aldbury arrived on Sunday to a damp Ballinger and were surprised that upon losing the toss were asked to bowl. Nick was soon run out by Humphreys whilst attempting third run and pulled his calf in the process. Not a good start to his walking holiday in the alps!! Paul was joined by Rollo and between them added 139 runs before paul was lbw for 87. Rollo continued in his aggressive style and was soon sending the ball to all parts of Ballinger. After two quick wickets he was joined by Ben Dugdale who hit a good 26. Tea was taken with Ballinger scoring 294-6 (a new club record) and Rollo not out on 139 after a true exhibition of power batting Aldbury`s rely had reached 103-2 before the rain finally finished the game off. Stuart picking up the two wickets to fall,,2011-06-30
815,<p>Ballinger win by 38 runs. A good win in our last league match## but not with quite the verve and excitement of Tuesday&rsquo;s win at Gerrards X. You can&rsquo;t do that every day. Marlow put Ballinger in on a damp grass strip## which was true but slower and lower than the boys might have been used to## playing as they do often on nippy astro pitches. That might have had something to do with the early departures of George Cooke and Fin Clark## both bowled. Ballinger were not used to being 12 for 2 after 2 and were not expecting it. But Freddie Thompson was as reliable as ever## clocking up his fourth retirement at not out 30 of the season so far. He has so far scored 210 runs in 8 matches at an average of 52.5 (4 not outs). He had good help from Taylor Levitt (12) and Joe Turrell (18) today## coming in at 4 and 5; but after that the Ballinger batting rather tailed off. All out for 106 off 19 overs was in the end a little disappointing against an attack which## after its opening bowlers had had their 4 overs each## was## to be honest## weak. Thankfully the Ballinger bowling and fielding display was excellent; and well led by Joe Turrell## who made intelligent bowling changes and field placings throughout. George Cooke as usual struck early to remove one opener## with the first of 2 catches by Taylor Levitt. Then the Marlow numbers 1 and 3 put together a well paced partnership of 29 which had them up with the required rate## despite good tight bowling from George and from Angus Denison-Smith. Joe then put himself on with Fin Clark at the other end and a gush of wickets followed - 3 for Turrell (2 bowled and one stumped by Freddie Thompson## moonlighting behind the stumps) and 2 for Clark. One Turrell wicket ball was described (by the bowler) as &ldquo;turning like Shane Warne&rdquo;. That was game over in effect. Jamie Fulcher (1 for 2 off 2) and Rory Bland (2 for 8 off 2## including another stumping) then started the mopping up operation. Fulcher&rsquo;s wicket was courtesy of a stunning catch just behind square leg by George Cooke## who is rapidly turning into a very good fielder indeed. That was nearly but not quite bettered by Taylor Levitt&rsquo;s diving catch off Bland in the next over. Very good fielding indeed all round## completed by a well taken run out to claim the last wicket. Stand out batting &ndash; Freddie## bowling &ndash; JoeTurrell## fielding &ndash; George Cooke. A very pleasing end to the league season. But it&rsquo;s not all over - I shall be organising some friendlies over the summer; and we still have a cup semi-final. Andy</p>,,2011-06-30
807,<p>Games against Great Kingshill have always been tight but we have never quite found the winning formula. &nbsp;Missing our two openners was a poor start - however so were Gt Kingshill so the teams were balanced. &nbsp;Again## we lost the toss as we always seem to and batted first...again. &nbsp;Posting our lowest total against this opposition of just 85## it seemed that history would repeat itself but not this time - Ballinger won quite convincingly but this was a game that ebbed and flowed and a result was never totally assured.&nbsp;</p> <p>The openning pair of Toby and Brandon started well with some good stroke play - keeping the run rate at around 5-6 and over. The loss of three quick wickets slowed proceedings down and the run rate dropped to under 4 an over. &nbsp;Brandon continued to be the key run-maker with some well timed hitting of the ball. &nbsp;The in-form Henry Turrell came in and scored 10 runs from just 7 balls before holing out. &nbsp; Brandon was the next to go - fine innings - his 25 coming from just 19 balls.&nbsp;</p> <p>Greg (9) and James McIntyre (13) put on an 8th wicket partnership of 27 runs - critical to get the total to something which we could defend. &nbsp;</p> <p>Despite an early wicket by Hamish## the opposition were going well at 25-1 off the first 5. On come Will Arnold and James McIntyre and instantly turn the screw. &nbsp;Will bowled with absolute precision## two maidens in a row - one being a double wicket maiden including getting the settled no.2. &nbsp;Tight bowling was critical because their no 4. Freddie had blasted 19 runs off 11 balls in the previous encounter. &nbsp;Frustrated on 5 from 13 balls## he went after James## miscued and Hamish caught it. &nbsp;Pressure was the key element and these two bowlers had changed the game completely. Gt Kingsill were 32 for 6 off 10 but Ballinger still had a job to do. &nbsp;</p> <p>Their number 8 was going along fine - suddenly a target of 30 runs from 5 overs looked achievable when he was scoring at well over a run a ball. &nbsp;Next in is Dom - again fantastic line and length - 1 wicket from 2 maidens and the point at which we won the match when Brandon## who had not made a single mistake all day including taking a very good run-out and no byes## did the fastest stumping I have seen taking the ball just next to the leg stump. &nbsp;At this point the game was won and just left Greg who late in the season had discovered that he good off-spin the ball a foot bowled a peach to the get the last wicket.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well done## Ballinger## this was a very good victory - made by the bowlers and some excellent glove work...season ends with won 5## lost 5 - probably our best season## when we are always up against the likes of Wycombe## GX and Chesham.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-07-02

872,<p>Having already won one game because The Lee couldn't put out a side we decided to see what could be achieved against replacement guests Hawridge and Cholesbury.</p> <p>It was a beautiful day and the pitch looked good and with no points at stake skipper Kerry had no hesitation in electing to bat having won the toss at last.</p> <p>Will Smith (33) and Max Dugdale(16) set off at 6 an over on another belter of a pitch but finally the H &amp; C bowlers sorted out their line and length. In particular Akram who bowled 7-4-8-2 of controlled seam bowling. Azam was doing the same from the other end and soon frustration set in amongst the Waggoners batters. First to go was Max followed by Bastie then Will. New man Hameen Thacker (10) was pleased to survive his first ball but started to show glimpses of hidden talents.Stuart McGowan was making a guest appearance and was looking in no trouble until sold a dummy by Brandon Allen. whose father Steve (11) had also made his first appearance for the Waggoners. Steve was out caught and was shortly followed by Ben Dugdale. There was then a rare sighting of the skipper with his pads on but it didn't last long when he was bowled by a 'jaffa'. Another newcomer Michael Burden (9*) and Will Reid(10) took us past the hundred mark but 117 was never going to be enough on this pitch.</p> <p>The sides enjoyed a long## leisurely tea interval## when they had chance to sample all the wonderful food provided by this weeks top victualler - Jan Kerry.</p> <p>Will Reid and Michael Burden opened up for the home side and kept the H&amp;C openers very quiet with Michael removing Drane in his second over for the club. Unfortunately this only introduced Mohammed who batted as though he was having a gentle stroll in the park. He was dropped twice on his way to 50 but was finally snared by Stuart courtesy of a very fine running catch by Bastie.</p> <p>Unfortunately the score was 80 and Hawridge had released one of their batters to go home so confident were they. Stuart now caught and bowled the other opener Rutt who had batted 21 overs for his 27.</p> <p>The rest of the visiting batsmen had been baiting the incumbents so as wickets fell it was now their chance to show how easy it was. They tried## Oh how they tried.</p> <p>Hameen (4-7) was bowling very tidily from the other end## another tidy over from Stuart meant after 24 overs the visitors were 96 - 3. Then the wheels fell off.

826,<p>When one thinks of the Ballinger/ Hyde Heath rivalry words like ardour## intensity## vigour## zeal and vehemence come to mind## todays game had passion and enthusiasm in abundance and it turned out to be a thrilling game of cricket. On a pleasant day Ballinger journeyed across to the heath to play in the incredibly important local derby which feels more like an Old Firm game or a Merseyside Derby rather than a game of fun social village cricket between these two picturesque villages. At precisely 2 oclock battle commenced and the crowds (all of 4 spectators) were set## the players chosen and the pitch was ready. Ballinger were put into bat and what seemed a greenish looking pitch which played fairly inconsistently with a few balls keeping low (my excuse for missing a straight one). Unfortunately I didnt trouble the scorers so when Joe was out for a brisk 6## Ballinger were looking down the barrel at 14 for 2. However the tide was somewhat turned by a very good partnership between the experienced and effective Jeremy and Paul of 90 which set the standards for the rest of the team to follow. Jeremy was out for 26 meanwhile Paul looked in imperious form as he compiled a serene 81. The platform was set from some lower order hitting and Jono (12)## Basty (10)## Graham(33*) and Jake(11*) all chipped in with very useful contributions however Ballinger still looked 20 runs short finishing on 205 After an excellent tea which included copious amounts of Chicken wraps homemade flapjacks and succulent brownies. Ballinger entered the fray again with a vicious combination of Jack Sideshow Bob Hankinson and Evan Webster both equally determined to maintain the Waggoners honour and carry them through to victory. However the Heath had the better start with Haddock and Capper starting the proceedings strongly and putting Ballinger on the back foot from the start. Evan then bowled a ball which was nicked to a wide second slip## despite the batmens best efforts at feigning innocence## the umpire was very quick to send him on his way. This brought Shrimpton to the crease who never really looked as easy edging and flicking his way to a streaky 24 before being given out LBW to Joe Hankinson## a decision he didnt seem pleased with. The Heaths number 4 came and went quickly and tamely this brought the explosive Burgham to the crease who smacked us about last year. However Jake Cutter ( 12 overs## 4 wickets for 58) was not in awe of his reputation and proceeded to bamboozle him with his spin## bounce## turn and flight before getting him deservedly stumped for a tame 3. However Capper was still at the other end and he seemed to be taking the game away from the Waggoners but cometh the hour## cometh the man and Joe Hankinson produced one of his best balls of the season (an in-swinging Yorker) to remove Capper for a well-crafted and belligerent 81. The next wicket was so textbook and was so well bowled that I feel it deserved a paragraph for its description. The context was that Jake Cutter had just dropped a sitter of a catch against the Heath number 8 batsman who had just come to the crease. What then ensued will go down in Waggoners folklore## Cutter living up to his name and using all his experience and guile produced a ball which Shane Warne/Graham best leg-spinner in the club Salisbury would have been proud of## it pitched outside leg stump and hit the top of off stump leaving the bamboozled batsman to trudge off back to the pavilion for a blob. We were into their tail and when Jack Hankinson was brought back on that ever-so sweet victory looking within reach. However Jack couldnt quite get it right and despite bowling at the Heaths last pair neither he nor and Evan could quite break the deadlock. The last over was incredibly tense with 14 needed and 1 wicket left all three results were possible## however Jack bowled an efficient over but couldnt break the stone-walling of Richards and Stevens who both proved to be highly experienced and difficult to remove. The final result felt more like a loss then a draw but in hindsight it probably proved to be a fair reflection of an enjoyable and exciting match which turned out to be a brilliant advocate for timed cricket rather then this 40 over nonsense## bring on next years match!</p>,,2011-07-05
764,<p>The Lee won the toss and## perhaps defensively as it turned out## elected to bowl. Ballinger&rsquo;s opening pair of Webster and O&rsquo;Kelly started steadily against steady bowling## but Richard went for 12## and the strike rate instantly jumped## with the advent of Rollo## who hit 26 off 21 deliveries (4 fours## 1 six) &ndash; the &ldquo;worm&rdquo; on the ipad scoring software (as demonstrated to an incredulous Gerry Hunting after the match) shot up. He too was bowled by The Lee opener John Humphreys. Rhodri and Rollo had put on 36## but then came the meat of the Ballinger innings with a partnership of 86 between captain Ian Davies and Rhodri## before Ian departed for 49 (after having had a couple of lives). Paul Humphreys had no such luck## holing out on the boundary over the bowler&rsquo;s head. Carlton Siddle (15) then put on 42 with Rhodri## who passed his fifty and then kicked on## before eventually he too holed out: an excellent innings## full of class - 78 off 97 balls with 10 fours. Thompson## Kellock and Maciver added another 30 between them with some swings (and the occasional miss)## to leave Ballinger on 226 for 7## a decent but not overwhelming total on a good track and fast outfield. This left the Lee needing 5 an over to win. It turned out to be well beyond them## since they were several batsmen light. The key for Ballinger was to remove their openers## John Swain and Warren Davis. Jack Hankinson got John Swain in the 7th over courtesy of a sharp catch in the slips from Ian Davies. But a 65 run partnership for the second wicket saw The Lee&rsquo;s hopes rise## until it was ended by Carlton Siddle## who then went on to snap up another wicket## caught behind by Richard O'Kelly. However## so long as Warren Davis was at the crease## The Lee had a chance. He alternated watchful defence with cleanly hit straight drives and powerful slogs (&ldquo;fetches&rdquo; if one is being kind) to cow corner. Thankfully for Ballinger his innings of 70 was ended when he fell lbw to Thompson. Carlton then took 2 quick wickets and Ballinger were in the hunt for a win. But on Davis&rsquo;s departure## The Lee had shut up shop &ndash; showing a truly disappointing lack of endeavor; and although skipper Ian Davies tried a variety of combinations of spin and seam## The Lee&rsquo;s numbers 8 and 9 batted out with solid## if rather boring## defence. A winning draw## but ultimately not entirely satisfactory. Rhodri Webster was obviously the pick of batsmen; and Carlton Siddle was the pick of the bowlers with 12 overs 5 maidens 37 runs 5 wickets.</p>,,2011-07-08
765,"<p>With the first half of the league season over## Ballinger were looking to consolidate their mid-table position by completing the double over bottom of the table Potten End. Somewhat surprisingly## Potten End## having won the toss (is Ian Davies losing his golden touch??) elected to bat first. Perhaps they had heard that BWCC were missing a number of key players## notably their first and second change bowling attack. What they obviously didn't know about was Ballinger's reserve strength! Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson gave Ballinger their customary accurate opening## and Potten End made slow progress on a flat wicket## with a very slow outfield affected by recent rains. Nick made the first breakthrough## with the total on 24## courtesy of a fine catch by Max Maciver## thankfully back in our ranks after a term's loan to Berkhamsted School. Another wicket fell at 31## this time a run-out resulting from some fine fielding - a feature of Ballinger's work on the daywas superlative ground fielding and throwing. The score had risen to 72 by the 22nd over## when drinks were taken. Due to a complete and regrettable absence of any Ballinger""supporters"" in the pavilion## the opposition had to make the drinks themselves. What they found## or put in them## is open to conjecture## as immediately play resumed the wheels fell off the Potten End batting and the Great Maciver Show started. The combination of Ian's bowling and Max's catching proved totally devastating## as the next 8 wickets fell in the space of 19 overs for 39 runs. Jono Lacey and Jamie Kellock chipped in with a smart catch apiece## and Potten End finished with a distinctly sub-par total of 111. Ian's bowling figures of 8 for 16 in 11.1 overs were truly exceptional## but even though he didn't take a wicket## Max's spell of 12 overs for 36 played no small part in Ballinger's dominance.. Had it not been for Potten End opener Pickard - 10th man out for a studied 43 - doubless their fate would have been even worse.</p> <p>So quickly had Ballinger bowled their overs that their batsmen had to face 11 overs before tea was due. In this time they lost Matthew Riley to a rather extraordinary dismissal## when the fielders all appealed for a catch## only for him to be given out LBW. Rhodri Webster was coping well with a more than adequate opening spell from the bowlers when he was undone by a sharp catch for a well-crafted 20. Max Maciver## who today could seemingly do little wrong## was joined by skipper Davies## and they had hoisted the score to 66 when the latter was caught for a fairly rapid 17. Max suffered the same fate soon after## but not before top-scoring with 29. In came Paul Humphreys to demonstrate an impeccable defensive technique for a while## before opening his shoulders## and it was a surprise when he perished LBW for 21## but by this time the total was 96 for 5## and sensible batting with masses of overs in hand would surely see Ballinger over the line. Will Smith provided exactly the sensible batting required## and Jamie Kellock applied the coup-de-grace with three thumping boundaries.</p> <p>This was a very heartening display## especially in the field## and let us hope that it can be replicated in the next few matches against tougher opposition.</p>",,2011-07-09
850,<p>Ballinger won the toss and elected to bat against a spirited Stokenchurch team. A quick opening partnership of 32 was ended when Will Smith was out for 12. Max Maciver and Joe Hankinson put on an an excellent 78 run partnership before both fell at 110## Max having made an excellent 43 and great to see Joe coming back to form with a powerful 46. This partnership was followed by a slight wobble in the middle as the score moved from 110 for 1 to 115 for 5. Sebastian Richards with a powerful 6 in his 12 and Ben Dugdale with an excellent 28 not out put the innings back on track and the icing on the cake was provided by George Kingston with a classic 4 and massive 6 in his innings of 10 not out. Ballinger finished on 163 for the loss of 7 wickets from 20 overs.</p> <p>Stokenchurch were always going to find the score reached by Ballinger hard to reach and their task was made even more difficult by a superb opening spell from Evan Webster of 4 overs## 2 of which were maidens and figures of 1 for 5. The remaining Ballinger bowlers returned excellent figures## with Jake Cutter getting 1 for 15 off 2 overs## Harry Rix with a fiery 3 for 19 off 4 overs and George Kingston with 2 for 12 off 2.2 overs.</p> <p>Well done to will Smith for his captaincy and to all the boys.</p>,,2011-07-13
748,<p>Ballinger travelled to top of the table Potten End with a team sheet showing 8 changes from last weeks winning team.</p> <p>Rob McIntyre was tasked with leading this disperate group and started with the usual losing of the toss. This meant Ballinger were given first use of what is always a sporting pitch.</p> <p>32 overs later the game looked all over when the visitors were dismissed for 127. Even this target looked unlikely at one stage but some very lusty hitting from new boy John Martin(43) and a well crafted 23 from Ben Dugdale helped give some respectability to the total.</p> <p>Unfortunately this also meant Potten End now had 53 overs to reach the target.</p> <p>Ballinger took the field without high expectation but a determination not to let down their absent leader and do their best for Rob. 'We got him in this mess so we'd better get him out of it' was the approach.</p> <p>What followed next can only be described as carnage. The Waggoners openers Mikey Burden 2-11 and Reece Tiley 2-22 soon had The End 25 -4. They were helped by some brilliant fielding from the skipper. Then Bastie 3-9 and Richard Burden 3-16&nbsp;took over. Within under 19 overs Ballinger had destroyed the home sides title ambitions## bowling them out for just 60.</p> <p>Some great fielding including 6 catches helped the cause. With a scoring umpire as well it was pretty well a perfect day for the Waggoners.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-07-22
767,"<p>Having already lost fairly comprehensively to Knotty Green earlier in the year## Ballinger woulld have been apprehensive in facing the return fixture with a number of key players absent. In the event it was KG who were the more depleted## having arrived with only ten men## some of whom were eleventh hour selections. Stand-in skipper Riley won the toss## and on another rain-affected wicket opted to field first.</p> <p>KG openers Hill and Widdowson seemed fairly untroubled by Ballinger's opening attack of Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson## posting a half-century stand for the first wicket## although Hill was missed in the slips. That was as good as it got for KG## as smart catching led to a breakthrough## with some good fortune when Nick## in dropping a sharp return catch## managed to deposit it straight onto the non-striking batsman's stumps as he backed up. Carlton Siddle## thoroughly disapproving of being carted for a six## struck back with the KG's captain's wicket courtesy of a good catch by Joe Hankinson. Nick finished his allotted spell with 3 for 37 off 12 overs## and then Andy Thompson created havoc with the tail## taking 3 for 8 in only 4.4 overs. KG had slumped from 50-0 to 98 all out## and only 33 overs gone.</p> <p>Ballinger had to face 12 overs before tea## and Matt Riley and Danny Draper coped well against pace at one end and spin at the other## until in the last over before the break## Matt had the misfortune to get a fly in his eye just as the ball left the bowler's hand## neglected to play a shot## and was clean bowled## for a well-struck 22. Danny followed shortly after tea## commendably ""walking"" to a thin edge to the keeper. Joe Hankinson got a brute of a ball and was gone for a second-ball duck## and a familiar Ballinger wobble at 33-3 was on the board.&nbsp;But Jono Lacey## inspired perhaps by a fine aggressive knock in the earlier fixture## decided to repeat the experience## and mixed (nervous) defence with (profitable) attack## well supported by an extremely watchful and responsible Paul Humphreys. However## KG's Widdowson was bowling a very testing spell which## coupled with a daft run-out of Jamie Kellock induced a touch of headless chicken syndrome in the Ballinger dressing-room## as the tailenders## not expecting to bat## rushed to get ready. Having lost two wickets with only 2 runs needed for victory## surely Ballinger could not lose from this position??&nbsp; No - they didn't## but really the game should have been wrapped up much more easily.</p> <p>KG did well to stay in the game for as long as they did## and took their defeat in good part## joining us in the pub afterwards for some (rather early) beers.</p>",,2011-07-24
876,<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;particularly strong batting &nbsp;performance by Ballinger set the base for a convincing victory against Chalfont St Peter after skipper Sebastian Richards had won the toss and elected to bat.</p> <p>Harry Bartlett set the tone by taking 12 off the first over before perishing to a caught and bowled in the second over. This brought Joe Hankinson to the crease to partner Max Dugdale and they proceeded to plunder the Chalfont St Peter bowling attack in a partnership of over 100. Max Dugdale eventually falling for an excellent 57 which included four 6s and seven 4s.</p> <p>The middle order batsmen## Sebastian Richards## Jack Bull## Jamie Wise## John Martin## Ben Dugdale and George Kingston contributed some lusty blows in support of Joe Hankinson. Joe batted through to finish on 88 not out and displayed real maturity in his inningswhich included five 6s and twelve 4s</p> <p>Th eventual total of 211 runs for the loss of 7 wickets off 20 overs being one of the largest totals in recent years and well done to all the players.</p> <p>Not to be outdone the bowlers tore into the opposition's batting. Evan Webster gave an excellent lesson to all aspiring bowlers at Ballinger&nbsp;pitching up to the batsmen and allowing time for the ball to swing. Evan was rewarded with superb figures of 5 wickets for 8 runs off his 4 overs.</p> <p>Evan was well suported by Joe Hankinson in his opening spell. Harry Rix 2 wickets for 13 runs off his 3 overs and George Kingston 1 wicket for 19 runs off his 3 overs maintained the high standard of bowling before the opposition's inninings was finished by Ben Dugdale 1 for 26 and Harry Bartlett with 1 wicket for 4 runs off his over.</p> <p>A superb&nbsp;performance from all the players## well captained by Sebastian Richards and an excellent end to the League Season.

768,<p>A nine wicket disaster in May on their own&nbsp;ground was a result that Ballinger were keen to avenge## and with a strong team available the omens were good - except that WESM were a close second in the league## and had won all four of their last games.</p> <p>Ian Davies made a good start by winning the toss## and given the reputation of the Widmer End wicket## had no hesitation in asking them to take first knock. His decision looked more than justified when## by the end of the eighth over## Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson had WESM reeling on 12 for 6 wickets. The batsmen had little answer to their bowling## which exploited a pitch that more than lived up to its reputation## and they both ended up with 4 wickets apiece. The dismissal of the dangerous B Saeed to a smart slip catch by Paul Humphreys off Jack was perhaps the turning point in the game. Lewis and R Shah managed to drag the score&nbsp; towards a semblance of respectability## aided by a couple of missed catches## but their final total of 66 all out in the 25th over left Ballinger with## surely## an easy target..</p> <p>The pitch was## if anything## worsening and Ballinger suffered a disastrous start## losing Max Maciver LBW to a shooter first ball.Rollo followed soon after## caught off a flashing cut (edge?) to third man standing motionless on the boundary## then Paul Humphreys tried an unwise (on this wicket) attacking shot## and was caught off a skier. 14 for 3## and some commonsense application needed. Joe Hankinson joined Richard O'Kelly## and both played exceptionally well in a half-century partnership that took Ballinger to a winning total## without further loss## in the 19th over.</p> <p>In some ways it was a pity that such a glorious sunny day should see only 44 overs of cricket## but another good win should&nbsp;encourage us&nbsp;for next week's encounter with league leaders Holmer Green.</p>,,2011-07-30
750,<p>Having been in third place two weeks ago the seconds suddenly found themselves third from bottom without having played a game.</p> <p>This wasn't a problem to the skipper as he knew he had a decent batting side## they were playing on a very decent pitch and he was going to win the toss and bat.</p> <p>Two&nbsp;out of three wasn't bad then as Ballinger set off in hot pusuit of the 250 plus that was going to be required. Some interesting shot selection## an umpiring decision that required DRS and a runout that was worthy of a Mr Bean episode left the home side in complete dissaray.</p> <p>Paul Branigan(49) avoided buying a jug but with 'Blunter' Thompson helped steady the Waggoners paddle. They definitely didn't have the canoe yet. The skipper helped 'Blunter' add a few more precious runs but 147 was never going to be enough on what was now a decent batting track.</p> <p>Unfortunately the skipper hadn't managed to lose the match ball which meant his bowlers were doomed to using a ball that looked vaguely like something the rabbit dragged in. Launching this projectile in the right direction might have helped the home sides cause but## with the exception of Alex Howe## this was beyond the wit off all.</p> <p>Haddenham turned up with a few new players and were annoyingly noisy but frankly this was one of the 2s poorest performances.

769,"<p>If matches depended on the outcome of the first overs of each innings## Ballinger would have won this one hands down. Put in to bat by a Holmer Green side notably shorn of many familiar faces## Ballinger took 12 off a wild first over from the pacy D&nbsp;Little## courtesy of 2 no-balls##5 byes##&nbsp;1 wide and a 4 by Paul Humphreys which ricochetted off Nick Adams' car into (or over) the hedge## never to be seen again. Much as we despise the MBL Kookaburra balls## this was an expensive loss## as the second new ball was therefore in use before the end of the first over!</p> <p>There followed a thoroughly professional opening stand of 64 by Paul and Andy Thompson## broken when Paul was out for 27 to a smartly taken catch. By this time the scoring rate had slowed## and the arrival of Rollo at the crease would hopefully see this situation remedied. Alas## after a couple of trademark boundaries## he changed his mind in mid-shot and lofted the simplest of dollies## which was gratefully accepted. Ian Davies was greeted by a field designed to nullify his productive offside/third man areas## and became increasingly frustrated## taking nearly 3/4 hour over his 6 runs before being bowled## although admittedly Andy was taking much of the strike and accumulating steadily. The bowling was## perhaps unexpectedly## becoming&nbsp;more accurate## and the fielding was exceptionally athletic## so runs were hard to come by. Even Carlton Siddle found himself tied down## to his annoyance## as it became more and more apparent that Ballinger would need to accelerate if they were to post a competitive total. He was out with the score on 172## and two more wickets promptly fell - the rock-solid Andy took one chance too many and was run out going for a sharp second run## having made a valiant&nbsp;61## and been twice hit on the helmet. Jamie Kellock followed## bowled for a golden (again## Jamie?)## and then Jeremy Hunting and Nick Adams tried in vain to locate the boundary## but could only gather singles. 187 for 6 at the end of the 45 overs was below par for a good track## especially as 50 of them (including 28 byes) were extras## but it remained to be seen what this Holmer Green side had in the way of batting.</p> <p>Act 2&nbsp; of the ""first over"" saga saw Nick Adams take 2 wickets## both bowled## so with the scoreboard reading 0 for 2 things were looking pretty good. Sadly neither of his victims was the prolific M Watt## nemesis of Ballinger bowlers often before## and Nick's next over cost 14 runs. Jack Hankinson got rid of the HG number four## but that was really as good as it got. Watt and Wallace made&nbsp;batting look like child's play## and the score mounted at an alarming rate. Carlton came in for some savage punishment but at least got rid of&nbsp;Wallace## caught for 50 by Ian Davies## whose shriek of triumph could have been heard in The Lee. Jeremy Hunting caught an absolute blinder - the first catch this season that he hasn't dropped (his own words)## but Watt continued on his merry way to score the winning runs and bring up his own century. A superlative innings## and only 33 overs used. Ballinger's fielding couldn't match their opposition's## but the the older members of the side certainly didn't disgrace themselves. It was simply that we weren't good enough## against a team that deserve to be league leaders and have a greater depth of players.</p>",,2011-08-07
770,<p>The holiday season hit Ballinger's availability list with a vengeance## and the Team Secretary endured a torrid week. The resultant XI that presented itself at Ley Hill looked somewhat short of bowling## but as skipper Ian Maciver lost the toss and was asked to bat first## this potential deficiency was put on hold## and it was the batsmen who had to stand up and be counted. Which they did## initially## very successfully. Another half-century opening stand between Richard O'Kelly and Andy Thompson saw them through to 65 before Andy departed for 22## a mixture of watchful defence and profitable hooked boundaries. Batting wasn't easy on a pitch where the ball would sometimes stop and rear up## and the next wicket fell almost immediately## with Max Maciver out. Meanwhile Richard was batting confidently## and with Paul Humphreys also going well at the other end## the score had reached 97 when## surprisingly## Richard was bowled when a 50 looked a certainty. Nigel Kerry## dragged unwillingly from his beloved 2's## followed in the blink of an eye## thereby unhappily gaining the honour of collecting the match fees. then Paul rather gave his wicket away with a skied catch.&nbsp;Jamie Kellock struck a few lusty blows before similarly holing out## and newcomer Gary Bunce looked ill at ease&nbsp;and soon perished LBW. That made it 116 for 7## with only 32 overs used. Jeremy Hunting was by this time hitting the ball hard## and Ian Maciver joined him in a useful stand until he too offered some catching practice. In came Monty Thompson to give an exhibition of stonewall defence to make his father proud. Jeremy continued to pepper the boundary until his luck too ran out##for an excellent 39## &nbsp;and then last-man Nick Adams finished the 45 overs with some panache## to get Ballinger to a total of 179 for 9 .</p> <p>The big question was now whether the Ballinger bowling attack was going to able to cope. Well## cope it did for a while## and very economically whilst Nick was operating. He struck in the 7th and 13th overs to take the first two wickets## and finished with impressive figures of 2 for 20 off his 12 overs## but runs were leaking badly at the other end. Nevertheless## thanks to a splendid display of wicketkeeping by Richard ( a catch and&nbsp;no less than three stumpings!)## coupled with Ian's wily&nbsp; spin (4 for 43) Ballinger had Ley Hill struggling at 127 for 7 in the 30th over. Then the wheels rather fell off## as it took only another 8 overs for Ley Hill to smash their way past the Ballinger total.</p> <p>Both teams were evidently weakened&nbsp;by holiday absences## but in the event it was Ley Hill's change bowlers who made the difference.

The second new recruit## David Kidde## also fresh off the plane from Australia## stamped his authority straight away with a classic cover drive and the 5 an over run rate soon ticked up to six.

In 1863 the town of Lawrence in Kansas was savagely destroyed by Confederate guerillas## the &lsquo;Quantrill&rsquo;s Raiders&rsquo;## in what is so imaginatively named the Lawrence Massacre. Furthermore## to add to this image of brutality it was in 1770 that James Cook forcibly conquered Eastern Australia for Great Britain naming it New South Wales. As a result## it was with some anxiety that the captains took to the pitch as the mighty Ballinger Sunday side rolled into the picteresque village of Cookham Dean and attempted to claim a small piece of Berkshire to add to the multiple scalps they have already taken this season.</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">The first act of this blood-thirsty drama was that of the toss. Many see the toss as &lsquo;Much Ado About Nothing&rsquo;## but for Ballinger and Captain Marvel Salisbury## this really was a tale of woe as The Waggoners were sent into the field to slave away in the afternoon sun. Whilst opposition to the disestablishment of the Church of England could be called antidisestablishmentarianism## Ballinger were certainly antilosingthetoss## however what doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger. So with renewed vigour The Waggoners rose from the changing room like a Phoenix out of ashes and began the difficult task of trying to keep their unbeaten Sunday record intact. The comparison to the great Waggoner sides of yesteryear is inevitable and in front of Ballinger was a side that had them 5 wickets down for 5 runs last season so this was no walk in the park. We could not count our chickens and had to play each game as it comes if you like your clich&eacute;s.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">Opening up for The Waggoners from the Pavilion End was Jack Hankinson and from the Big Tree End was crowd favourite Jono Lacey. Both started tightly and for the first few overs the run rate struggled to get above 3 an over as the tigerish Ballinger fielding yielded no easy runs with Jake Cutter being particularly mobile despite having a broken leg. Superb. Unfortunately for Ballinger## the opening Dean partnership looked comfortable and began to up the scoring rate as Hankinson and Lacey veered off line with Wells-Cole being particularly severe## driving gloriously over the top on more than one occassion. As the opening partnership reached the 30s## Ballinger introduced an idea so revolutionary that only two team mates knew about it. The concept is called &lsquo;the tactical drop&rsquo;. The idea is to intentionally drop a batsman to lure him into a false sense of security about the parlous nature of the teams catching and then when the next chance is offered snaffle it at the first attempt. Quite brilliant. So as Lacey and Hankinson were into their last overs## Jono offered a lovely juicy wide long hop to Dean opener Brooks who fired it straight at Will &lsquo;gun show&rsquo; Smith. Unfortunately## having spent the past 936 days in the gym Will was too stiff to bend down and attempt the catch so took the bold decision to tactically drop it. 2 runs later this decision was vindicated as Jeremy Hunting took a stunning catch at third man as he sat down to have a picnic on the outfield.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">Unfortunately## this brought the dangerous Patel to the crease who along with the well set Wells-Cole steadily upped the run rate against Ballinger&rsquo;s toiling opening bowlers. The breakthrough came when The Waggoner&rsquo;s first change bowlers came on. From the Big Tree End was club professional Paul Humpreys and from the Pavilion End was Stuart McGowan. Slowly but surely## they brought the run rate down with Ballinger being particularly sharp in the field## with special mention to Jamie Kellock who gave a textbook performance behind the sticks as Paul delievered a variety of liquorice allsorts## a lot of pearlers but the occassional dross. Fortunately## it was more the former and both Paul and Stuart kept the Dean batsmen at bay with Stuart keeping an impeccable line and length. The frustration clearly set in as Patel tried to swipe Paul out of the ground one too many times and spooned a catch to Will &lsquo;gun show&rsquo; Smith at cover who this time pocketted a neat catch away to his right hand side. Following Patel## was the key wicket of dangerman Wells-Cole who was undone by a beauty from Stuart. Having come down the track## the ball spun past the bat and Jamie## quick as a flash## took the bails and waved Wells-Cole on his way for a well made and chanceless 48.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">From here on in the quote &ldquo;always expect the unexpected&rdquo; by James Patterson is very apt as Ballinger really were about to see the &lsquo;unexpected&rsquo;. From a comfortable 75-1## Paul and Stuart tore through the rest of the Cookham Dean batting line-up like a hurricane tearing through a small wooden house. This even included another use of the &lsquo;tactical drop&rsquo; concept## this time by Jono who dropped Dean&rsquo;s big hitter Wilson on the boundary. This went unpunished however as only a few balls later Paul cleaned him up with a rather good delivery. Dean thus collapsed to a rather meagre 104 all out as Paul took 6-16 off 8.3 overs and Stuart played a very valuable supporting act taking 3-24 off 9. Whilst it maybe harsh to describe the Dean&rsquo;s lower order performance as a floccinaucinihilipilification## Ballinger most definitely took advantage of the Dean&rsquo;s collapse and as a result were only chasing 104 when earlier 200+ looked on the cards.</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">Folllowing an excellent tea which included a rocket salad## coleslaw and also scones## Ballinger opened up with Will and Basty. And my word what a start we had. To say that the capacity crowd were on the edge of their seats was an understatement as the opening pair rocketted towards the target## treating each and every Dean bowler with equal disdain and contempt. After 8 overs Ballinger had reached a staggering 11-0 and what followed was an exhibition of cricket in its purest form. Our good friend &lsquo;Boycs&rsquo; would have loved it and as he## more than anyone else would tell you## crease occupation and not losing wickets is of paramount importance. To be fair to Will and Basty they did exactly this and took the sting out of the accurate opening Dean bowlers## Turner and Wells-Cole. Whilst Basty played second fiddle## it was Will who accelerated the scoring exhibiting his newly found strength## lofting a couple of lovely straight drives for 4 and it was with the inevitablility of a cow on a conveyor belt in an abattoir that Ballinger marched to victory. Soon the 50 partnership came up and it really was like watching Brazil## well maybe not## but Basty looked a picture of calm as slowly but surely Ballinger crawled towards their target.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">Unfortunately## hopes of a 10 wicket win were well and truely condemned to the rubbish bin as Basty was caught trying to hoick Brooks into next week## but unfortunately only ended up getting into a tangle and being caught for a very well- made 27. As he slumped off like a centipede with 98 missing legs## Tom Maw joined Will in the middle with the scores on 69-1. 5.4 overs and 38 runs later the game was over as Will reached 52* and Tom 19* which included 2 crowd pleasing sixes. As a result the Ballinger Sunday machine rumbles on with another win## with many pundits making comparisons to &lsquo;The invincibles&rsquo; of Preston North End in 1888-9. Regardless of that## Ballinger once again gave a very professional and ruthless performance and whilst the paper&rsquo;s have been critical of wonderkid Smith&rsquo;s new fitness routine## the &lsquo;steriod jerk&rsquo; certainly silenced his critics with yesterday&rsquo;s performance.</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">So on the 38th birthday of Google&rsquo;s co-founder Sergey Brin## it was Cookham Dean who were left searching after Ballinger inflicted a 9 wicket defeat on the home side. All in all## it was an excellent result for the away side played in very good spirit## with a very nice tea and at a lovely ground!</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">And finally## dear reader## I will leave you with a bit of Winston Churchill## who famously said that &ldquo;these are not dark days: these are great days - the greatest days our country has ever lived.&rdquo; Indeed## these are great days and would be even greater by continuing the winning ways at Wendover next Sunday.</span><br /><br /><span class=""yiv875184732apple-style-span"">Word of the day: pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis - a supposed lung disease.</span></span></span></span></p>",,2011-08-29

Jeremy lost the toss (dont ask where Graeme was) and the Waggoners were put into the field on a pleasant day with a nice but large ground. Some are born great## some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them and at roughly 2:05 with our usual opening bowler Jack Hankinson still driving to the game## greatness was thrust upon our overseas pro Matt Riley who bowled with such tenacity and skill he silenced his critics (me) and was probably the standout bowler with effulgent figures of (12 overs## 4 maidens## 48 runs and 3 wickets). In the meantime your humble correspondent dropped an unforgivable catch to let the opener off the mark. However in the process of my debacle on par with the titanics maiden voyage## I sustained an injury which would have felled any normal man however I managed to solider on through to pain## but 7 overs later my herculean effort could not be sustained and when the doctor said they would have to amputate if I didnt come off the field I succumbed to the pain## in reality my thumb was bruised and I made a fuss about it. However back to the interesting stuff## Alec Howe had a brilliant first and second spell and finished with very credible figures of (12 overs 41 runs and 3 wickets). The Langley number 3 batted superlatively and compiled an imperious 95 before unfortunately being caught in the deep. At 160 for 4 in the 33<sup>rd</sup> over things could have got messy but some inspired captaincy and bowling managed to peg the opponents back to a competitive score of 216 all out from their 45 overs credit to Jack Hankinson who bowled faster than the news of the world scandal unfolded and got 3 wickets in the process.</span></span></span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""><span style=""mso-tab-count: 1;""> </span>Now onto the important bit## Tea.

Ben clean bowled top-scoring G Perry for 38 in only his second over## and went on to take 3 for 22 with his well flighted spin## whilst Carlton chipped in with three wickets at the other end## as The Lee crashed from 96 for 4 to 124 all out## with the clock showing only 2.58pm and a mere 26 overs elapsed. Ballinger's fielding and catching were mostly well up to the high standard they have set all season.</p> <p>125 was hardly a target that a strong Ballinger batting line-up was going to find difficult## especially on yet another good Kellock track. And so it proved## as Richard O'Kelly and Joe Hankinson took the score to 47 in rapid time before the first wicket fell## when Richard ran himself out going for a sharp second run## doubtless hoping to speed up his (chanceless) contribution of 6 to the partnership. &nbsp;Is he the new Riley??&nbsp; At the other end Joe was mixing sublime driving with some productive edges## and keeping scoreboard operator Felix McIntyre busy while in the kitchen his mother agonized about when the tea interval was likely to occur. Husband Rollo arrived at the crease to smash a typically robust 20## including 2 sixes## before fatally testing the umpire's goodwill by heaving across the line. Joe perished## as a catch was at last accepted## for an exciting knock of 71## leaving it Paul Humphreys and Jamie Kellock to steer Ballinger serenely to their target## reached in a mere 25 overs## and the time only just half-past four.</p> <p>Time for tea (delicious)## then off to The Lee&nbsp;to watch Nigel's 2's having a much less happy time of it. Disappointing that we didn't have a full-blooded challenge for the last match## but very encouraging that the day belonged to our youngsters## with a Hankinson bonanza## and excellent bowing by Ben Dugdale.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-09-05
866,<p>The last league game of the season as against one of the top sides in the league but hen Ballingers bolers had reduced them to 23-3 after 8 overs they looked anything but. Unfortunately hat the boys have discovered is that the better sides have strength in depth and an onslaught by Wycombe's Daniel took the visitors to 108 off their 20 overs.</p> <p>108 isn't that tough an ask if the batters play properly but after an excellent opening stand beteen Brandon (22)&nbsp;and James Mac(13) the rest of the order subsided gently with no-one else getting into double figures. 80-10</p> <p>This was a dissapointing end to what had been an enjoyable season but the difference between the Waggoners and table toppers Chesham and High Wycombe is marked. Maybe a different approach by the coach in bringing in better players from the younger age groups would have helped but that ould have penalised all the boys ho turned up for training each week.</p> <p>I think it's going to be a busy winter.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2011-09-07
754,<p>Last game of the season and we're away to local rivals The Lee. With a decent side on the team sheet the skipper was quitely confident when he went out to toss up. An unusual looking pitch with lots of grass didn't deter him from batting first when the unexpected happened and he won the toss.</p> <p>Max and Tom Mac opened up for the Waggoners and for 4 overs all looked completely serene with Tom especially looking in masterly form. Then the wheels fell off. All out for 116 with extras top scorer with 24.</p> <p>116 was always going to be a difficult total to defend on a ground where 200 plus is par## but giving the home side 50 overs to score them in made it even worse.</p> <p>The bowlers all did their best with Will Reid&nbsp;(6-0-16-0) being the pick but the Lee had a couple of&nbsp;wily old pros opening the batting and they weren't &nbsp;split until the 30th over when the score was already 96.</p> <p>Everyone fielded well but it was a shame to end another enjoyable season with a defeat. We also went from 3rd from top of the league## with a chance of getting promotion## to 3rd from bottom in to weeks.</p> <p>It as great to see the 1s supporting us and it was a great evening afterwards.

834,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">&lsquo;I have a dream...&rsquo; Martin Luther King Jr.<br /><br />In times long## long ago## Ballinger opened the Sunday season with a friendly against Aldenham. On that day## Sunday captain Salisbury had a dream. A dream so powerful that even many of the Ballinger stalwarts refused to believe. He dreamt of an unbeaten season## he dreamt of the Ballinger Sunday side of 2011 being written in the history books for eternity as one the finest teams to grace this planet. And so## on the 48th anniversary of Martin Luther King Junior&rsquo;s infamous 'I Have a Dream' speech the story of Ballinger&rsquo;s quest for immortality begins.<br /><br />An eerie silence befell the dressing room. Usually## a team full of energy and razzmatazz## the Ballinger dressing room was reduced to quiet contemplation with each one thinking of the challenges that lay ahead. For the Waggoner warriors did not want to follow the same path as Portuguese leader Christov&atilde;o da Gama who in 1542 was captured and executed by the Turks at the Battle of Wofla## but indeed they wanted to successfully defeat Wendover much like Theodoric## King of the Ostrogoths## who defeated Odoacer at the Battle of Isonzo in 489 allowing him passage into the northern Italian state of Piedmont. So on this big day a small prayer was offered far away in some unknown paradise to aid the Waggoner warriors in their attempt to keep their unbeaten season going:</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">Our father##<br />who art at Fortress Ballinger##<br />Cricket be our game##<br />When Wendover come##<br />It will be won##<br />On grass as it is on water.<br />Give us this day our daily beers##<br />And forgive us our celebrations##<br />As we forgive those who celebrate against us.<br />Lead us not into our own wickets##<br />But deliver us to victory.<br />For Ballinger is the kingdom##<br />For the maroon and the gold##<br />Forever and ever...<br /><br />The air smelled sharp as new-cut wood## slicing low and sly around the angles of buildings and with it the coin was tossed and it was decided that Ballinger would take to the field first on a wicket that clearly had taken a pounding by the overnight rain. Time would tell if it indeed would cut like a trench from the Somme. However with a new cherry in the hand and breeze at their backs Ballinger were as eager as a child in a sweet shop to get the game under way. Did I mention Will got 7 A*s? So with crowd favorite Lacey unavailable## it was Alex Howe and Jack Hankinson who opened the bowling for Ballinger and both kept the Wendover batsmen at bay as both bowled tight and hostile spells. Half way through Alex&rsquo;s spell came the first wicket. Unbelievable telepathic skills from the side&rsquo;s Sri Lankan overseas player Paul Humphreys saw Tom Maw placed at short mid wicket and following an excellent delivery the ball was clipped straight into Tom&rsquo;s hands. One wicket down## nine more to get and Ballinger could not have asked for a better start! Furthermore## with Ballinger tight in the field## runs were hard to come by## although C. Morley showed that considerable application was the only way to build a score on a pitch that had a similar coloring to that of sticky toffee pudding.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">Soon enough the Waggoner&rsquo;s rolled another Wendover batsman as Hankinson bowled Bhagarra and it was clear that Ballinger now had the bit between their teeth and looked hungry for more wickets## the kind of look you get from not eating for a while. However## as much as they huffed and puffed and tried to blow the house down## Walton and Morley (C) were creating a rather nice little partnership and as Ballinger&rsquo;s change bowlers came on the scoring rate started to slowly rise. Unfortunately## little Jake Cutter bore the brunt of this as the lack of sun meant that he could not top up his tan and thus bowl well. However## Evan Webster at the other end did a good job stemming the runs although it was the aforementioned Cutter who made the breakthrough by having danger man Morley (C) caught by the now standing Jeremy Hunting at mid on for a well made and patient 50. This wicket seemed to open the floodgates somewhat and on the anniversary of British geologist William Smith&rsquo;s death it was left to the previously mentioned Humphreys to gobble up the rest of the Wendover middle order## using an excellent and mind-boggling combination of swing and movement## much like californication which refers to the haphazard and mindless development of land that gobbled up most of Southern California during the 1970s.<br /><br />This combined with an athletic fielding display## especially from team stalwarts Simon Denison-Smith and Jeremy Hunting## who belied their years and hurled themselves around the field like several species of African game with little respect for mind or body. Furthermore## this was coupled with another successful use of the &lsquo;tactical drop&rsquo; concept## this time by Alex Howe. Unbelievably## this led to a very important wicket the very next ball! Good work! Ballinger&rsquo;s standards in the field were as a result high and this was exemplified by two excellent diving catches by## firstly## Evan who judged a swirling high ball to perfection and secondly by Jake who despite his broken leg from last week## managed to fling himself to his left hand side like a salmon and pouch the ball. So at the end of 43 over&rsquo;s Wendover declared on 126-8 off 43 over&rsquo;s with Walton (P) excellently holding the lower order together. Anyhow## a score of 126## one would have thought## would not be enough especially given the star studded Ballinger batting line- up that the away side had at their disposal.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=""background: white;""><span lang=""EN""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>After a superb tea and your correspondent subsequently putting on a stone of weight courtesy of the awesome mini cornish pasties## it was Will Smith and Freddie Denison-Smith that opened up for Ballinger. And much like last week Ballinger raced at the speed of light and an early finish was a distinct possibility with Ballinger rattling along to 6 off 6 over&rsquo;s## as Smith was particularly brutal hitting two outstanding singles in a fine innings. Unfortunately## all fairy tales must come to an end though## and having hit two glorious singles## Challoner&rsquo;s reject Smith tried to cart Wendover opener Siva into next year; unfortunately## the ball was straight and uprooted the middle stump. Very sad## I admit I shed a tear. Anyway## with Tom Maw replacing Will and Freddie looking technically very solid in both attack and defense## the Waggoner&rsquo;s## slowly but surely## began to trundle towards the target set. Tom Maw began to open his shoulders and hit a couple of lusty blows and the score was at 31 when the next wicket fell with Freddie departing. However## cometh the hour## cometh the man. Next in was Paul Humphreys who following his exploits with the ball played a superbly paced innings that so nearly won the Waggoner Warriors the game. As the run rate increased## as both Tom and Paul ran well between the wickets## Wendover decided to bring on their change bowlers and what an impact they had.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">At this point## I would like to preface what I am about to say by saying that the double bouncing delivery is one that many professional 20/20 cricketers try (and fail to master). Furthermore## Neil Pinner## an off-spinner who plays for Worcestershire's second XI argues ""It just makes it so much harder for the batter to hit it out of the ground## which is what they are trying to do in Twenty20 cricket"". So when Wendover captain Morley (C) brought Bhagarra on to the bowl from the Shrubbery End it can now be seen as a tactical master stroke## on par with dare I say Ottmar Hitzfeld&rsquo;s tactical masterstroke as his Swiss side battered Spain into submission during World Cup of 2010. Anyway## a combination of a slow pitch and the &lsquo;unusual&rsquo; bowling some Sky pundits have called &lsquo;filth&rsquo;## it did the job as Paul and Tom struggled to get it away## and furthermore led to the latter's wicket as he attempted to put the ball into oblivion## but only ended up missing the ball and being bowled for 21. The old adage of 'batsman misses bowler hits' is very apt here! Anyway## Paul was joined by Bastie who hung around for a while but the next wicket&rsquo;s partnership was the game changer. Paul and Jeremy put on 50 for the 5th wicket and with 6 required off the last over## this really was a nail biter. A cool head was needed much like Old Oundleian## Will Jefferson who cruelly crushed Lancashire&rsquo;s hopes in the 20/20 semi final the previous day with a professional and ruthless display of batting in the super over decider. Unfortunately## having taken Ballinger so close to the brink of victory that they were about to fall off## Paul was bowled in final over and despite the team&rsquo;s best efforts a very tidy over from Siva kept the Waggoner&rsquo;s cruelly at bay. In the end## Paul made a superb and pugnacious 54 whilst Jeremy ended on a hard fought 14 not out and Ballinger closed another ultimately successful day at the office on 123-6 off 40 over&rsquo;s.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><span lang=""EN"">So there we have it## another game goes by and Ballinger still remain unbeaten! Those doubters who cast away Salisbury&rsquo;s dream are beginning to eat their own words as there are now only 4 games to go to make it the perfect season. Overall## it was a rather tricky away day at Wendover who once again proved to be excellent hosts. An excellent close game## a great tea## friendly opposition playing in the glorious rolling hills of the Chilterns## what more could one want on a summer&rsquo;s Sunday afternoon? Answers on a post card please.<br /><br />After the game it soon emerged that Ballinger starlet and opening batsman## Will Smith## had been poached by an unknown rival funded by a foreign Saudi Arabian consortium. It is rumored that he has been whisked off to be looked after by the Worshipful Company of Grocers of the City of London at a school that has been described as &ldquo;a popular## well-oiled## well-heeled co-educational boarding school which is riding high.&rdquo; Whilst these rumors are unconfirmed## a tearful Jake Cutter gave the following interview to the Sky cameras present## ""Will should have been playing for Oundle weeks ago. I rate Montague Cuthbert-Montgomery as a high-class first XI school batsman## but in one-day cricket I don't believe his game suits batting through. Will has real magic## he ticks every box## and he is a little professor of his industry.""<br /><br />The Ballinger Wagon rolls on to Chesham Bois next week as once again Ballinger look to keep the unbeaten run going. </span><span lang=""EN"">Best of luck guys!</span></p>",,2011-09-16

882,<p>First the drought## then the rain and finally the first game of the season on May 11th on a very chilly evening - a rearranged league and cup double at Great Kingshill. Everyone would be rusty I was thinking until the second over when Max smashed a big six onto the road at the start of a brilliant attacking innings(45). He and Robert put on a big partnership of 60 for the first wicket in eight overs. Our other batsmen kept the momentum with notable contributions from Ben and Toby## taking Ballinger to a useful total of 134. Toby survived a bizarre incident at the start of his innings when the ball looped down out of the sky## nicked his bat## then on to the keeper's helmet## then deflected and finally caught at slip...but it was a no ball(and apparently you can't be caught if the ball has hit a fielder's helmet).</p> <p>Hamish and Reece opened up with a fast## furious and fierce opening spell. Both are a several mph faster than last year and both openers were soon back in the pavilion. GK had a useful partnership for the third wicket but were gradually falling behind the required run rate. Ben eventually got the breakthrough with first of two stumpings by Max. Joe and Josh bowled well at the end and each picked up a wicket or two. Fielding a bit rusty at times## but a good team performance and a match played in good spirits.

Then with his 4th ball he removed GX's other opener. End of 1st over 1 for 2.</p> <p>Will Arnold opened from the other end and was a bit profiligate giving away 2 runs. Another tight over from Hamish## A wicket from Will in his next over## Reece Tiley has arrived like the cavalry and takes a wicket in his first over## Will then takes 2 in in 2## Greg McManus gets 1 in his first## so## at the end of the 10th over GX are 18-8. At the end of the 14th they are 36-9.</p> <p>Unbelievable stuff from the Waggoners. Great fielding as well was backing up this top effort from the bowlers. Will Arnold's figures were 4-4-4 with Hamish 2-6 in his 4 overs.</p> <p>How&nbsp;GX then got to to 72 is difficult to understand. A lack of bowlers - see rugby presentation## school match etc - was the problem with the skipper running out of options and the last 2 GX&nbsp;&nbsp;batters recognising there were no devils in the pitch and played properly. 72 was probably a par score on a slow pitch with a very slow outfield.</p> <p>The home side opened with Brandon Allen and Greg McManus who tickled along nicely for the first 7 overs before a rush of blood led to Brandon being stumped. The skipper and Greg then added 19 for the next wicket before Hamish was bowled with the total on 37.</p> <p>&nbsp;If the Waggoners had removed GX's last batter when they should have they would have won the game by now.</p> <p>Toby Lyons## Henry Turrel and Reece Tiley all helped Greg add a few## but by now it was pitch dark and drizziling. Ossie Glenister helped Greg add another 10 before being part of Greg's run out. Now it was down to Ossie## Will Arnold and James Reid to get the Waggoners over the line. Sadly they couldn't quite manage it with the home side all out with 2 balls to go just&nbsp;3 runs short. An excellent innings from Greg deserved a win.</p> <p>Could 1 more player have made the difference - YES.</p> <p>Should the game have been stopped&nbsp;- YES -but both sides thought they could win so carrying on was the right decision.</p> <p>A long match report but it was good game in difficult conditions.Both sides made lots of noise in the field but the game was played in the right spirit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2012-05-20
928,<p>BWCC ventured onto a cricket field for the first time in 2012's sodden spring## with a team mainly rich in years and experience## and facing a Ley Hill side that had been skittled for only 58 the previous week## might have fancied their chances of denting their morale still further.</p> <p>The home side having won the toss took first knock## and must have feared the worst when Carlton Siddle struck with the third ball of his opening over## courtesy of a blinding slip catch by Matt Riley. With 12 overs gone the total had reached a mere 22## and Carlton and Nick Adams were keeping tight control. However## C Peterson was starting to hit the ball hard and## profitting from a missed chance behind the stumps## was in dominant form## and his partnership with the adhesive Lown had put on 114 for the second wicket before Peterson was out for 76 in the 29th over.Three more wickets went down## as Ballinger's bowlers regained their ascendency## and with the total on 137-5 in the 34th over## prospects were favourable. Enter Messrs Jone and Cartledge who proceeded to give a remarkable demonstration of the potential of the cross-batted agricultural approach## and the fielders watched helplessly as the sixes flew over their heads## the road## and the golf course.. 95 runs accrued from this carnage and changed the face of the game## before a few late wickets added a touch more respectability to a final total of 248-8## with Andy Thompson emerging with the best bowling figures of 4 for 59.</p> <p>Ballinger's reply was encouraging## and the openers Matt Riley and Paul Humphreys batted steadily## with Paul doing most of the scoring before he was bowled for 30. Jeremy Hunting perished in no time## but Carlton and Jamie Kellock looked in good nick before both were victims of totally unneccessary run-outs which effectively cost Ballinger any chance of winning the game. This is not the place to apportion blame (is it??)## so let us merely applaud Matt's powers of concentration in posting a well-crafted 50. At the 34 over mark## Ballinger were only 2 runs behind the comparable Ley Hill score with the same number of wickets down. However## well though Andy Thompson and a (remarkably) watchful Nick Adans batted## supported by skipper Ian Maciver## there was no way they were going to match the pyrotechnics of the Ley Hill middle order## and attention switched to salvaging a draw## which to their credit they duly achieved## finishing on 183-7.</p> <p>Our reward in league points was virtually the same as we had gathered in each of the two previous rain cancelled fixtures## but at least our season was under way.</p>,,2012-05-20
920,<p>Wow - that was a cracking start to the season. A lovely grass pitch had just been prepared at Holmer Green## after 3 weeks of rain and re-arranging matches. Chilly but dry!</p> <p>Theo Weatherall &amp; Harry Petrie opened the batting in style## putting on 20 runs between them in the first 4 overs (10 each). The loss of a wicket (a decent ball to be out to) was cancelled out by the extras from Holmer Green. Hannah Bates scored a beautiful boundary but both she &amp; Elise Farquhar waited in vain during 4 overs for something else to score off (22 extras!). Raphael Weatherall &amp; Georgina Kellok shared a similar experience: Raphael scored a classy boundary## but then lost a wicket. Marcus Coulter &amp; Jamie McMullan batted as the fourth pair## scoring 2 runs each (and 18 extras) - Marcus lost a wicket## but didn't make the same mistake twice (well done both boys for their first game for Ballinger!). Finally Will Hardman and Will Jones came in to bat as the final pair## snatching several quick singles without loss and really putting the pressure on the Holmer Green fielders. Final score: 300 runs for 3 wickets (breakdown: 38 runs; 80 extras conceded by HGrn## 3 wickets x -6)</p> <p>Will Hardman (Captain) did a fantastic job setting the field## and raising the game with an increasingly attacking field. Theo W was an awesome Wicketkeeper## who was forced to deal with some very variable bowling - well done! A few catches were missed## but Ballinger picked themselves up and 3 stunning catches were eventually taken by Will Jones## Will Hardman and Jamie McMullan (whose full somersault and safe hands brought huge applause from everyone!) Raphael bowled a maiden over## and Harry P bowled a wicket maiden - excellent. (Harry had definitely had 3 shredded wheat that morning!!) Harry P: 4 for 1 off 3; Will Hardman: 7 for 2 off 3; Will Jones &amp; Raphael both had 4 for 0 off 2; Hannah 5 for 0 off 2; Elise 7 for 0 off 2; and a huge smile from Georgina when she took a wicket (caught) 13 for 1 off 2. Some excellent fielding from everyone - a particularly impressive start from Marcus Coulter## Jamie McMullan and Will Jones. Final Score: 250 (for 4 wickets). Breakdown: 26 runs conceded; 46 extras from Ballinger; 4 wickets taken.</p> <p>Well done kids - great fun! (WH)</p>,,2012-05-22
891,<p>With all the boys&nbsp;on both sides knowing each other from their various schools this was always going to be a keenly contested match&nbsp;but once more Ballinger started a match with only 8 players on the pitch. 2 more arrived at the end of the 1st over and finally Toby Lyons arrived to take over the gloves from a very releaved Monty Thompson.</p> <p>Hamish Sim was quickly into his stride and a briliant catch by Henry Turrell gave him his 1st wicket. With Reece Tiley on top form at the other end runs were hard to get. Chesham's batters were taking some excellent quick singles which led to some interesting field placings.</p> <p>Will Arnold came onto replace Hamish and once again proved the virtue of line and length giving away&nbsp;just 5&nbsp;runs in his 4 overs whilst taking&nbsp;1 wicket. Greg McManus was on at the other end and quickly removed Chesham's No3. Tom Mckinley now joined Alex Goodman for the home side and these tewo batted very sensibly mixing aggression with good running between the wickets. They took Chesham's total to 102. It was difficult to decide whether this was a par score because the outfield was quite slow but the wicket was very true.</p> <p>It was soon obvious that the Waggoners were going to struggle against some tight## but not particularly penetrative## bowling from Chesham.&nbsp;The run rate quickly climbed to 7 an over as Ballinger failed to copy the efforts of the hosts in looking for singles. Greg McManus was then bowled by a straight ball from Sam Rance's first ball## Monty and Toby then contrived to run out Toby##&nbsp;Henry Turrell was looking in good 'nick' and had started to bring the run rate down before he fell foul of another mix up with Monty. The skipper then failed to lead by example## holing out to his first ball##Dom Brown produced some lusty blows which started to bring the gane back to the visitors.It&nbsp;even gave them a small glimmer of hope## but his departure left the&nbsp;Waggoners with just too much to do over the last 3 overs and they finished 10 runs short.</p> <p>Once more this was a game we should have won. Some very strange field placings and&nbsp;an inability to manage a run chase were two of the more obvious causes of the defeat.</p> <p>On a different note the game was played in an excellent spirit and at last in beautiful sunshine.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2012-05-24

929,<p>A cloudless sunlit Ballinger cricket ground was the setting for BWCC's first (actual) home game of the season## against newly promoted Bradenham. The visitors opted to take first knock## and from the very first ball their opening batsman Rafiq launched a violent assault on the bowling## being particularly severe on Nick Adams## whose first two overs went for 23. One feared that unless he was soon got rid of the match might shortly be all over## but Nick had his revenge in his third over## thanks to a splendid catch by his fellow opener Carlton Siddle## who had been keeping the other end under tight control. The wicket fell with the total on 30## of which Rafiq had made 28 in 12 balls.</p> <p>The match now settled down to an even contest ## and skipper Maciver rotated his bowlers in short spells## whilst the No 3 bat Ghafoor proceeded steadily to a useful 59 before being bowled by Carlton. Meanwhile young Evan Webster bowled an excellent spell## taking 2-27 in his six overs## and a young newcomer Josh Badrick contributed an economical four overs for 9 runs.. With the scoring rate coming under increasing pressure## the Bradenham batsmen tried hard to speed things up## but only R Ilyas## with a rapid 33 not out containing three 6's achieved much success. Andy Thomson was the only bowler to bowl his full allotment of 12 overs## and although wicketless conceded a miserly 28 runs. Conversely## Nick who suffered so badly from the earlier onslaught was unfortunate enough to come under the cosh from Ilyas## and although he bagged two wickets they came at a price of almost 9 an over - very un-Nick like! A final total of 204 for 8 on what looked like a very good batting track (take a bow## Jamie) looked a very achievable target.</p> <p>Paul Humphreys and Richard O'Kelly set about this target in fine style## with Paul particularly aggressive## until he was surprisingly## bowled for 36.Thereafter&nbsp;it was basically the Richard O'Kelly show. Wickets fell at 85## 101## and 119## and it was not until Carlton joined him that the match looked Ballinger's for the taking. Carlton fell LBW for an excellent 29## leaving Andy Thompson to partner Richard past the target## with four overs to spare.. Richard finished on 103 not out## a magnificent and perfectly paced innings.</p> <p>Maximum points for Ballinger## enhanced by the very welcome arrival of Roger Webster## who agreed to umpire for the remainder of the game## thus gaining us three points which we hadn't counted on. The game was played in an excellent spirit## too## an added bonus.</p>,,2012-05-27
946,<p>At last the Waggoners 2nd X1 got on the field of play and what a beautiful day and ground to start on. Bradenham is one of the prettier grounds we play on and all though slightly quirky with it's slopes the views are wonderful.</p> <p>Skipper Kerry started the day in fine form by losing the toss but Bradenham chose to bat anyway. This&nbsp;saved him the embarrasment of having to ask them to bat on what was going to be a very hot day.</p> <p>Ballinger's side consisted of three adults and then eight boys with an average age of 13. Not ideal and Bradenham obviously thought this was going to be a stroll in the park.</p> <p>Ballinger's boys had other ideas and after a couple of wayward overs Dom Brown and Tom Petrie settled into their stride and kept the Bradenham openers under the cosh.&nbsp;After the first 10 overs the score was&nbsp;just 30 with Dom having taken the teams first wicket of the season.&nbsp;</p> <p>First change&nbsp;introduced seasoned professional Bastie Richards. Last year wasn't one of Bastie's best and the skipper was a little worried. He needn't of been. Bastie quickly slipped into a good rhythm. By the end of his spell Bastie had the excellent figures of 4-49 including a hat-trick. At the other end James Fray had started his first spell in adult cricket and again held his line well but he topped his bowling efforts by taking the most stunning catch off his own bowling.</p> <p>Enter Freddie Thompson. With his first ball in adult cricket Freddie produced a beautifully flighted leg spinner which Bradenham's Mottram chipped to short mid-wicket. At this point something amazing happened. Paul Branigan leapt salmon like to his left to take a fantastic catch.</p> <p>With some excellent fielding and top bowling The Waggoners had reduced the home side to 139-9 with just 8 overs to go. Unfortunately the heat and number of overs began to take it's toll on the fielders and over these last few&nbsp;overs Braddenham's final&nbsp;wicket racked up another 60 runs. Very annoying.</p> <p>Ballinger opened up with Peter Petrie and Bastie but Bastie was soon back in the hutch after a silly run-out. Peter was then joined by his son Tom. I'm&nbsp;sure Ballinger have had father/son batting partnerships before but one involving a 12 years old batting at 3? These two added 82 for the 2nd wicket before both fell in quick succession. Paul Branigan and the skipper were both undone by shooters and it looked like an early finish.</p> <p>&nbsp;Enter Harry Glenister. Fresh from a rowing training session Harry regarded the wielding of a bat as much easier fair and set about the Bradenham bowlers with great gusto. With Dom Brown they added a rapid 29 for the 6th wicket and suddenly the Bradenham fielders were panicking as Harry brought the winning draw within reach. Sadly it wasn't to be and the Waggoners finished 12 runs short of the target.</p> <p>A really enjoyable game played in the right spirit and great effort by all of Ballinger's juniors. Bradenham were fulsome in their praise for the boys.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2012-05-27

930,<p>A fixture against bottom-of-the-table Knotty Green presented a welcome opportunity for Ballinger to bank some valuable league points## and with stand-in skipper Carlton Siddle (has Ian Davies emigrated??) winning the toss## Ballinger's bowlers were given first outing against their apparently out-of-form opponents. All went well for a while## and with four wickets captured for only 46 by the 15th over## Knotty Green appeared to be following the form book.. However## their left-handed No 3 bat D Williams was definitely not suffering from lack of form## and profitting from a culpable dropped catch before he was off the mark## proceeded to give a batting master-class in taking advantage of some increasingly loose Ballinger bowling. Other half-chances went begging## and then a belligerent knock by M Kumar## scoring 55 at No 8 saw the scoreboard fairly rattle along (metaphorically## that is## because Knotty Green are now the proud owners of an imposing new electronic scoreboard)## with all the bowlers## except Carlton## taking punishment. Williams should have cruised to his ton## but some uncooperative partners saw him stranded on 99 not out at the close## when Knotty Green had amassed 233 for 8.</p> <p>Ballinger were quickly off to a good start## Matt Riley and the in-form&nbsp;Richard O'Kelly scoring freely## with 46 on the board before Matt exhibited splendid sportsmanship by walking to a catch at the wicket## which the umpire and eleven fielders all deemed to be not out. Rollo## making one of his rare (just-in-time) appearances for the side then joined Richard## and they were in little trouble until Richard was caught for a well-hit 40 out of 81 for the second wicket. By this time the bowlers were getting considerable lift off the wicket at the pavilion end - something Ballinger's bowlers had failed to extract - and the slip cordon steadily multiplied. Max Maciver## Paul Humphreys and Jamie Kellock all smacked some resounding boundaries## but in between a lot of fresh air passed between bat and ball. Meanwhile Rollo## having painstakingly passed his 50## a signal normally with him for a violent assault on tiring bowlers## unaccountably decided to perfect his defensive technique and eschew any attempt to keep up with the run-rate. Nick Adams was promoted to produce one of his famed blitzes## but barely got going## and by the time Carlton arrived at the wicket in the 42nd over a losing draw looked more than likely. However## the Knotty Green skipper decided to toss the ball to a new (and presumably untried) member of his team## with catastrophic (for him) results## as Carlton smashed 21 off 12 balls## and Rollo at last came to the party## finishing undefeated on 80 not out## as Ballinger passed their target with three balls to spare.</p> <p>Nail-biting stuff## but Ballinger made it unnecessarily hard work for themselves.</p>,,2012-06-04
898,<p>After being put in## Freddie Thompson and George Cooke batted superbly in a big half century opening stand for Ballinger before Freddie had to retire for an excellent 30 while George made an impressive 25. The middle order accumulated a few but also lost wickets steadily including a poor run out. Apart from that Ballinger's running and calling had been very good. Ollie Moir(15 NO) and Jamie Kingston(16NO) came together at the end and really kicked on in the last two overs including 20 off the last over with Jamie thumping three successive fours and Ollie joining the fun. 110-6 looked to be a useful total## though not easy to defend with a very short boundary near the car park.</p> <p>Beaconsfield were tied down at the start by some tight bowling by Ballinger &nbsp;(George Cooke## Freddie Thompson## Jamie Kingston and Joe Turrell) and looked to be out of the game midway through their innings at 39-4. But their middle and lower order counterattacked nicely and they got back in the game as the pressure mounted on the bowlers and fielders. They had a good 5th wicket partnership going until Rob Farquhar made the breakthrough with two wickets in two balls. Beaconsfield's lower order kept on and even though they kept losing wickets edged closer to Ballinger's score. With the last pair batting there were six to win off the last over from Ollie Glenister (who had already picked up a couple of wickets). Three scored off the first three balls## then a dot ball## three to win off two balls.....then a crazy attempted run by the number 11 and well taken run out.</p> <p>Ballinger had scraped home to win a nail-biter by 2 runs. It shouldn't have been so close. The game was played in a good spirit by both sides.</p>,,2012-06-04

885,<p>Little Marlow batted first on a very soft and slightly damp wicket. Their batsmen all struggled to score and wickets fell steadily throughout the innings against a spirited Ballinger team. Our lads were queueing up to bowl and the game provided an opportunity to try out a few irregular bowlers. Having said that Ben was again the pick of the bowlers &nbsp;with 3-5 off 4 overs but it was great to see Jes## Ollie## Toby and Freddie all picking up wickets; but there were a disappointing number of wides conceded from the occasional bowlers so that is something to work on. Max had a great game behind the stumps with three stumpings and two run-outs. LM were restricted to a meager 60 all out which was never going to be a severe challenge. Our experimental opening partnership gave a coupe of lads a chance to play a good innings## but the experiment failed. After that the Dugdales got stuck in to the bowling; Max seemed to be in a hurry to get things done with another couple of huge sixes and Ballinger cantered home in 9.5 overs. Both sides played the game in really good spirits and although a one-sided affair it was great to see everyone get a chance to contribute.&nbsp;</p>,,2012-06-06
984,<p>Cup games arranged during half term are always difficult to get out a full strength team## however## we had some very good players. After some heavy rain yesterday and during the night## and yet more forecast for the rest of the week## we persuaded HWCC to go ahead and play!</p> <p>Henry King captained## won the toss &amp; elected to field first. Some excellent bowling from openers Simon Carlin &amp; Harry Petrie. Will Hardman bowled very economically at 4## and Charlie B bowled a maiden over in his 2nd over. Simon## Harry P## Dylan &amp; Will Hardman each took one wicket (bowled)## plus 2 runouts from Simon's overs. A couple of near runouts## and a couple of nearly caughts ... but the fielding was generally better today. HWCC finished on 91 for 6.</p> <p>HWCC only needed to bowl line and length today## and to keep their heads in the field. Simon scored 17 (he'd already lost several lives before finally being caught!). Hugo scored 25## and looked as though he would have to retire## but decided he would tempt fate with a kami-kazi run .... and was indeed run out. Henry K scored a decent 7 before being bowled## but the run rate slowed right down## and HWCC began to gain confidence. Charlie B (at 5) and Theo (at 6) faced some accurate bowling## but there was still a lot to do. The score was 59 at the end of the 10th over## and still only 69 at the end of the 16th over - only 10 runs scored in 6 overs!! A quick shower interrupted play for a few minutes## and after an opportune team-talk## Theo &amp; Charlie knew they needed to really increase the run rate.&nbsp;</p> <p>There was a bit of confusion with the rain interruption and the scoreboard: how many overs left? and how many needed to win? .... and for one moment## we thought we had another over to go## and just 3 needed to win; in which case the game would have been ours!

There was immediately much muttering about how low down the order various batters were.</p> <p>They needn't have worried as their team mates earlier in the order felt sorry for them and decided to either hit the ball to one of only 6 outfielders## get their pads in the way or pull muscles that hadn't been used for 20 years.</p> <p>Peter Petrie ( (34) and Bastie( 23) made full use of the wide open spaces then Ben Dugdale and Paul Branigan added 82 for the 5th wicket before both were LBW in quick succession. They were followed by an unbroken stand of 99 between Daren Samat( 56*) and Reece Tiley (33*). Both batted very well against some mixed bowling.</p> <p>After an excellent tea Ballinger set about the job of taking 7 wickets.</p> <p>Reece got the home side off to a good start with a wicket in his first over and it soon becam apparent that the visitors weren't going to delay the envitable too long.</p> <p>Tom Petrie took a wicket in his third over then Ben ( 3-7)&nbsp;and Reece ( 3-9)&nbsp;finished things off.</p> <p>With a scoring umpire on both sides meant maximum points for Ballinger.

985,"<p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">Ballinger won the toss and chose to bat but tight bowling made it very difficult to score and wickets fell as our lads attempted to get the scoreboard moving. Dom played a great innings and held the team together but 84 was never going to be enough. Their opening pair set about this sub par total with Saif Zaib looking to finish the game in quick time. He was dropped on 15 and then made us suffer. Our bowlers found it difficult against quality opposition and the pressure told with some eratic bowling that was severely punished. The boys stuck to their task in what was always going to be a losing battle.

931,<p>Cricket - boring? predictable? Not this match !!&nbsp; It proved that however obviously a team is staring defeat in the face## fortunes can change in dramatic fashion. In this case it also demonstrated that having youngsters in the side can compensate for the failings of their elders!</p> <p>Up against Holmer Green## league champions last season## and vying for the leadership this season## prospects did not look too rosy when## after being sent in to bat first on a wicket that had miraculously survived the week's downpours## Paul Humphreys was back in the hutch with only 10 on the board. Andy Thompson was joined by by Max Maciver## and they slowly set about repairing the damage## to such good effect that with both batting increasingly fluently their partnership had yielded 96 before Andy was bowled for an excellent 46. Max went on to a vitally important 56## made over two hours## but at the other end the batting fell steadily apart. Ian Davies## fresh from his international travels## departed to a catch behind## Will Smith went LBW first ball (his day was to come on the morrow!!)and Jeremy Hunting perished second ball to a full toss. Carlton## as usual## batted positively but was left high and dry##&nbsp; though there were a few lusty blows from Jamie Kellock## Ian Maciver and Nick Adams## before the overs ran out with a total of 180 for 8 on the board.</p> <p>Past experience## and the current batting form of Holmer Green's openers Kevin King and M Watt indicated that early wickets would be vital. Great joy then## as Watt launched the fifth ball of Carlton's first over skywards with skipper Davies waiting expectantly right underneath it. Joy rapidly transformed to grief## as the ball thudded through (round?) his hands to the turf## upon which Davies buried his face in aforesaid turf in misery - and possibly to avoid looking at his team-mates. This would be the only opportunity to get rid of Watt## who rubbed salt into the wound by plundering 26 of Nick's third over. But the Gods pitied Ballinger## and up went another skyer off Carlton's fourth over## this time with Jeremy on hand to clutch it - which he did## only for a subsequent juggling act see the ball once more on the turf. The Gods by now had had enough; the score raced up to 125 without loss## only 15 overs gone## and Ballinger were looking very unhappy bunnies.</p> <p>Desperate Davies now tossed the ball to Evan Webster and Max Maciver. There followed one of the more remarkable collapses seen on the Ballinger ground for many a year. Watt was clean bowled by Max for 98## 82 of which had come from boundaries in 43 balls## when it looked a cast-iron certainty that he would cruise undefeated past his 100 and see off the winning target with ease. King soldiered on but increasingly defensively## whilst Max wrought havoc at the other end. Evan took 1 for 12 in his very tidy 6 overs## whilst Max narrowly missed the all-time Ballinger bowling record in taking 9 for 21 in a staggering exhitition of spin bowling## as Holmer Green lost 10 wickets for 27 runs in the space of 16 overs.</p> <p>So the Gods had finally decided to show Ballinger that if the oldies couldn't do the job## the young ones certainly can! Incidentally## there was also an excellent display of keeping by Will Smith behind the stumps. Joy## and for some## profound relief## as Ballinger left the field## and a sporting## if utterly bemused reaction by the Holmer Green players. Not that they went to the pub.....</p>,,2012-06-11
917,<p>Horrid weather closing in rapidly at 5.30pm. Agreed with GX to play 10 overs each side and then review the weather/pitch conditions/light. We allowed GX to bat first because several of their players still hadn't arrived by 6.10pm.</p> <p>Playing for the first time on grass (to avoid the lake now surrounding the pavilion!!) Simon Carlin &amp; James Arnold opened the bowling with their usual exciting pace and really kept the GX batsmen on the back foot. Theo W kept wicket superbly## and the changeover in the field was quick## maintaining the pressure on the batsmen and keeping the run rate down. Ballinger were rewarded with 5 good wickets in the first four overs## and GX crumpled under the onslaught. (A great catch by Harrie Petrie## and two great catches by Charlie B.... who nearly caught a 3rd as well.)&nbsp;</p> <p>The rain started## but Harry Petrie continued the excellent bowling## and kept both batsmen from scoring any runs in his 2 overs (a few extras only due to very slippery conditions for a pace bowler).

Simon scored an impressive boundary off the first ball## and the opposition's faces fell. He and Charlie took a little while to get in sync## and certainly faced some very fast &amp; accurate bowling from GX. Both boys were bowled (better than being caught)## but were out to very good balls - no shame there. Theo batted at 3## settling in at the crease quickly and comfortably## before pushing the run rate back up again and scoring a very impressive 14## not out.

886,<p>A strong all-round batting display saw Ballinger pile on 158. Max and Robert got us off to a flying start -this was one of Robert's best innings yet and he smashed a six through the covers into the carpark in the second over to get things moving. Then Will Reid played played a superb innings for 39 &nbsp;off 21 balls with the ball flying around and Ben also batted superbly. Both were out to run outs which should not have happened although there was some excellent fielding and direct hits by GK fielders. These and some tight GK bowling slowed the momentum for &nbsp;few overs in the middle of the innings. However Hamish continued the onslaught later in the innings with a quick-fire 31no off 15 balls. 158-6 was going to be a challenging total for GK to chase.</p> <p>Our bowling was really good with accurate and tight bowling from eight different bowlers. Of particular note were Will and Reece who tied GK down from the start## Rob Farquhar and Will Arnold were both accurate and economical## and Jess Thomas and Joe Shepherd who both took wickets at the end with Joe taking 3 wickets in the final over. Our strong team bowling performance and good ground fielding made it hard for GK to score apart from Joe Thomas who scored an impressive half century but who didn't find enough support. Our strong all-round performance played in great spirit was only marred by some dropped catches so more practise is required as this will be much more important in closer matches. As it was Ballinger won by a big 52 run margin.</p>,,2012-06-18
932,<p>With the pitch wet after yet another sodden week## Carlton Siddle## leading the side&nbsp;again## in the absence of both Captain and Vice-Captain## decided to field first ## a decision that looked to have&nbsp; paid off when J Cox## a regular destroyer of Ballinger bowling## was caught by Jamie Kellock behind the stumps for only 10. His fellow opener (father## S Cox) then batted so tentatively against an accurate attack on an unreliable wicket## that the scoreboard barely crept along## as wickets fell steadily. Nick Adams recovered from his traumas of the previous week to bowl 6 maidens in taking 3 for 22 in his 12 overs## well supported by Evan Webster (3 for 42 in 10)## and a fine## economical spell by Paul Humphreys (welcome back to the ranks of the bowlers## Paul!) who conceded only 17 runs from his 12 overs. Cox (snr) having reached double figures in the 27th over (!)## was eventually out for 26## but an irritating partnership of 25 for the eigth wicket saw league leaders Downley post 135 for 8 after 45 over.</p> <p>Normally such a target would be well within Ballinger's capabilities## but the weather## very windy all afternoon## deteriorated with some heavy rain at the tea interval## and continued thereafter with frequent showers. Although this would handicap the bowlers## it also greatly slowed down the outfield## which had only been partly mown due to an equipment breakdown. Taking their cue from the Downley batsmen## Matt Riley and Paul Humphreys batted even more cautiously (12 on the board after 10 overs!)## then Paul was bowled with the total on 21## triggering a collapse## with few batsmen having much success in coping with the spin of D Willans. Only Matt batted with any confidence in top-scoring with 28. When 9 wickets were down for 70 with 9 overs still remaining## Ballinger appeared doomed. But## as usual## Carlton batted with true Yorkshire grit## and was impressively supported by 11th man Evan ## who batted out 29 deliveries for his 1 not out## and it was a damp and disgruntled Downley side who left the field somewhat short of the 25 points that had looked to be theirs.</p> <p>As a result## Ballinger remain by the skin of their teeth the only unbeaten side in the premier division## but have slipped to 5th place.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2012-06-18
893,<p>Ballinger batted first and soon started to pile on the runs in a dominating 69 run opening partnership between Henry and Monty. Henry played a splendid aggressive innings hammering the ball round the ground and reaching 50 before &nbsp;he retired while Monty was rather more measured in his 22. Then Greg came in and also played an excellent innings for 40 continuing the batting momentum. Freddie provided good support running lots of good quick singles to rotate the strike. The other batsmen were unlucky to miss out. 142-5 was clearly a good score against demoralized opponents.</p> <p>Reece bowled a marvelous opening spell and clean bowled three of the top order LM batsmen. It wasn't easy at the other end against Hamish who was unlucky not to take any wickets with his bowling## although he captained well and took a great run out with a &nbsp;long bullet throw after a chase to the long on boundary. Greg## Dominic## James and Matt all bowled well and picked up wickets as LM collapsed in a very weak batting display. &nbsp;The last pair hung on to deny Ballinger the last wicket with LM finsihing on 61-9. Our lads were very excited and upbeat and fielded very well too. Team spirit was strong and it was hard to fault the allround performance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2012-06-19
918,<p>A very young team from Ballinger with only 4 U11's due to school trips## but some up and coming stars proved their value as part of the squad today.</p> <p>Ballinger batted first with Hugo E-H and James Bunce (Captn) opening. The Winchmore Hill bowlers proved to be fast and accurate with a double-wicket maiden in the first over: 1 catch## and 1 LBW. The WH fielders and bowlers continued to keep our batsmen in the crease## and punished anyone who didn't keep the ball on the ground with some great catching.</p> <p>BWCC 35 all out (17 overs) - highest scorer again = Hugo E-Hart</p> <p>Slightly disheartened## but encouraged to go out and reply with some great fielding and bowling## the BWCC boys started really well with some awesome bowling from Harry Petrie (2 for 1 off 2) including a caught and bowled## plus a great first over from James Bunce. Matthew Barton bowled two really good overs with his new slower action (just 4 runs conceded in 2 overs). Winchmore's score was only 19 by the end of the 7th over (just 6 runs ahead of ours)## but they hadn't lost as many wickets.</p> <p>In Overs 8 to 10## the Winchmore Hill batsmen suddenly found their stride## and started to score boundaries. Matthew Gate's Over reeled them back in for a moment## but they weren't to be deterred## finishing easily on 37 by the end of the 10th over with 7 wickets in hand.</p> <p>A very good game of cricket - and a nice club to lose to. Everyone fielded well and contributed tonight - some excellent wicket-keeping from Hugo (no byes at all!)## and only 4 extras in total from our bowlers - very impressive!!!!

900,<p>As usual a bit of controversy when we play GX. This was a game that should never have been played because of the weather but as always once you start it's difficult to stop.</p> <p>GX won the toss and put the Waggoners in what was gong to be an interesting pitch. Tom Petrie and Freddie Thompson opened up for the visitors and were picking off singles quite comfortably and quickly added 20 before both fell trying to force the pace. James McIntyre was joined by Will Arnold and Will set about the GX attack with great glee. He and James added 41 for the 3rd wicket of which Will scored a brilliant 33*.&nbsp;There was then a scamble over the last two overs to try and reach a decent score which 74 was probably 10 short.</p> <p>The rain hen got worse and it was quite aparent tha Ballinger would struggle holding the ball but both teams wanted to play so off we went.</p> <p>A couple of early wickets## 1 each from Tom P and Will## got the Waggoners in the hunt but as the ball became more and more difficult to hold## a couple of catches went down and it all got a bit messy. GX had a match winner in big hitting Chris Daniels who put on 50 with Nial McCarthy&nbsp;and took the game out of Ballinger's reach. The home side got home with a couple of overs to spare.</p> <p>The boys enjoyed themselves which is more than can be said for a certain&nbsp;umpire.</p>,,2012-06-20

901,<p>Firstly it was worth noting that the sun was shining for our visit to Chalfont St.Peter.</p> <p>Batting first the home side were always going to be underpressure from The Waggoners opening attack. With Will Arnold once more displaying his consumate control over line## length and late swing and&nbsp;George Cooke giving nothing away at the other end Chalfont were 4 down by the end of the 5th over with the score on 7. Whiting then helped Crossley add 36 for 5th wicket with Crossley continuing until retiring for a well played 33.</p> <p>Ballinger eventually removed the rest of the Chalfont order but not until the last ball of 20th over by which time they'd reached 73.&nbsp;There was some good fielding with a couple of good catches from the visitors.</p> <p>Tom P and George set off after the target and looked in complete control until George spooned one to mid-on. Fred Sanders was then out first ball and Tom gave some more catching practice. By this time however Gethin Ross was in full flow and was despatching the Chalfont bowlers to all parts of the ground. He retired on 32 off&nbsp;just 21 balls. After his departure Ollie Fretton was run out## Will Arnold's&nbsp;innings was 'after the Lord Mayors show' so it was left to Rob Farquhar to smite the 6 that won the game.</p> <p>A good result and an all-round competent display by the boys.

933,"<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1.15pm. Two problems. Skipper Davies hasn't turned up in time to toss up (but then he does live on the other side of London). Selector Humphreys has ""done a Kerry"" and assembled a jury rather than a cricket XI. That said## it looked a very capable jury## and it was soon reduced to eleven when Ian Maciver volunteered to fill the umpiring vacancy## thus guaranteeing Ballinger at least 3 league points. Such was the strength of the batting line-up that Ballinger elected to bat first on yet another rain affected wicket.The creme de la creme of BWCC batting prowess then proceeded to resemble more a sagging souffle as the scoreboard lurched from 6 for 4 wickets by the 5th over to 22 for 6 by the 10th. Only Richard O'Kelly appeared to have any idea how to handle Cadmore End's excellent openers## and an on-going batting disaster zone suddenly nose-dived towards the tragic as Richard attempted to&nbsp; despatch a long hop from the first-change bowler's second ball into Blackthorn Lane## only to see his stumps scattered. The look of mortification on his face said it all. 31 for 7## and surely no way back from this one?&nbsp; Would this be Ballinger's lowest ever league score??&nbsp; Oh## such pessimism......&nbsp; For two of our doughtiest defenders in the form of Jamie Kellock and Evan Webster now started a dogged partnership that eventually yielded 64 runs for the 8th wicket## and broke the bowlers' grip on the game## as they inched the total towards a measure of respectability. Evan fell for an invaluable 20## but Ben Dugdale then joined the indomitable Kellock## and they hauled the final score up to&nbsp;128 as the final wicket fell in the 45th over. Jamie finished on 56 not out## surely one of his best ever league performances.</p> <p>Inspired by these batting heroics## Ballinger took to the field enthused## and in no time had two Cadmore End wickets down## courtesy of of a slick stumping by Richard O'Kelly and a lightning slip catch by Paul Humphreys. 7 for 2## and could the improbable happen? Alas## at 65 for 2## and only 18 overs gone## the answer looked to be ""no"". However## Cadmore's No 3 batsman made a serious mistake when he lofted the second ball of Carlton Siddle's second over out of the ground. Carlton doesn't like being hit for six! With a wicket in his 3rd over## and two more in his 4th## he transformed the Cadmore innings into a shambles at 73 for 6. The batsmen now tried to regroup## and desperate defence yielded a mere 22 runs in the following 18 overs## during which Carlton bagged a fourth wicket. At 99 for 8## sensing that the target was actually within range## they now upped the tempo## but were dramatically undone when the No 11 ran himself out with only 15 more runs needed## and four overs left. Carlton finished with 4 for 23 off his 12 overs## and Evan built on his recent excellent performances with 2 for 8 off 6 overs.</p> <p>A match of remarkable twists and turns saw Ballinger not only preserve their unbeaten record## but take maximum points from a match which had looked utterly lost at 2.05pm!</p>",,2012-06-24
950,<p>At last a game of cricket.</p> <p>The 2s travelled to the wilderness of Cadmore End with some joy in their hearts as they had a ridulous batting line up.&nbsp;There were&nbsp;a few concerns about the strength of the bowling but it wouldn't matter as we could chase down any score Cadmore offered.</p> <p>This was the basis of the tactics worked out by skipper Branigan in conjunction with his&nbsp; CinC the day before. It was only left to the skipper to manage the menial task of winning the toss.</p> <p>So it was plan B then. Score a huge total on yet another Cadmore batter friendly pitch and then bowl the home side out.</p> <p>It appears that none of the Ballinger batsmen were privy to the tactic as they happily played round straight balls## ran themselves out## gave simple catching practice to the fielders or even allowed the fielders to demonstrate an athelitiscm in taking a catch not often seen in this parish.</p> <p>Only an ill Peter Petrie(25) and David Kiddie(19) managed double figures## with Dom Brown helping Peter add 33 for the 8th wicket## as the Waggoners were bowled out for just 84.</p> <p>The CinC had told the troops that anything around 100+ would be a difficult target. Having let the home side get to 80 the lack of depth in their batting began to show and 4 wickets fell as they struggled to get the last 5 runs. Another 20 runs would have been too many for them.</p> <p>There was some interesting bowling with Dave the pick but Dom did an excellent job as well. James Fray fielded really well and managed to remove the End's top scorer but it was Bastie's 3-10 which stands out. Mainly because he hadn't got a clue where the ball was going so the batsmen had no chance.</p> <p>The bowlers were backed up by an excellent display behind the sticks from Max Dugdale. This almost made up for his first ball duck.</p> <p>Once again we left Cadmore End with a sense of frustration. We should have won &nbsp;</p>,,2012-06-25
887,"<p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">Chalfont St Peter 115- 4; Ballinger U15s 108-8</p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">We made a very good start in the field restricting Chalfont to 51-3 in 13th over. Our early bowling by Will## Hamish and Ben was economical although not very accurate and got some early breakthroughs. But then it all fell apart as Chalfont's No4 (Reif) took to the attack against some poor bowling by most of our other bowlers&nbsp;and slack fielding that&nbsp;included a concoction of no balls and wides## overthrows and three dropped catches. Two well taken run outs by Max and Ben's catch were scant consolation. Chalfont had gained the momentum and put 115-4 on the board.&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">Our run chase started very slowly against some very good bowling## which was directed on the stumps. It wasn't easy batting and bounce was variable but several of the top order were out to straight balls that hit or were going to hit the stumps. Dom was unlucky though as he got a pea-roller. We fell behind and lost key wickets. Will Reid led a fightback with a splendid innings over 18 overs and looked like he could win the game. He was ably supported by Dom## Hamish &amp; Josh## each of who scored 14. The game went to last over but there was too much to do and the game finally slipped away when Will was run out on second ball of the last over## and three more wickets followed## rather than the few runs left to win.</p> </p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">This was a disappointing loss for U15 against a team we had beaten easily earlier in the season. Narrow 7 run margin makes it harder as there were many obvious ways that number of runs could have been saved with more accurate bowling## better fielding or shot selection. We have to learn to play as a team and keep it tight when put under pressure.&nbsp;</p>",,2012-06-27

888,<p>In a brief interruption in the never-ending rain we managed to fit in a rare game of cricket against U15s archrivals Ley Hill in a top of table clash. It &nbsp;was inevitably a damp and soft pitch.</p> <p>Once again Max and Robert got us off to a really strong start. this time &nbsp;putting on 55 for the first wicket in 8 overs. Max played a superb knock for 51 off 30 balls punishing the wayward short-pitched early bowling from Ley Hill's attack. Robert (16) provided vital and solid support at the other end in another fine partnership. But then there was a collapse as the top order were out cheaply as it was hard to get going on such a slow pitch and LH tightened up the bowling and held their catches. Reece and Dom consolidated with another good partnership that took the total to 127-7. Given LH had chased down 160 in the earlier encountered we expected a good response.</p> <p>Will and Reece opened the bowling this time and put the batting side under pressure from the start with fast and accurate bowling. Reece's first ball was a superb unplayable fast inswinging yorker which dispatched LH's best batsman. The top order batsmen dug in and hung on although they found it hard scoring. &nbsp;Then Robert picked up the ball in the deep and hurled in a magnificent long throw to hit the stumps and run out the No.2. Brilliant fielding that lifted the whole Ballinger team. A procession of wickets started including three more run outs: the first another superb pickup and throw to the keeper Max by Toby## then another direct hit by Robert who's fielding was red hot and the third by Max. Robert also held a really good catch and Kenny joined in with a good caught and bowled. LH were demolished and all out for 50! We won the challenge cup LH had put up after a series of close encounters - but it wasn't close this time.&nbsp;Ballinger were on top of their game and showed remarkable spirit. Robert edged it over Max for Man-of-the Match. The boys moved top of the table although sadly it was the last league game of the season and others have games in hand.</p>,,2012-07-08
937,"<p>Defeat at the hands of a better team is acceptable. If you lose by playing badly## you've only yourselves to blame. So## this much-changed## ring -rusty (blame the weather!) Ballinger side must be wondering quite how things went wrong in this home fixture against Ley Hill. Loose opening bowling gave Ley Hill a rapid start## but Nick Adams and Jack Hankinson soon got their act together## backed up by excellent work in the field. Wickets fell steadily## and change bowlers Max Maciver and David Kiddie maintained the pressure## to the extent that when the 9th wicket fell## Ley Hill had only 98 on the board in 33 overs. Simulaneously their No 11 arrived at the ground## hurled himself out of his van## and managed to reach the crease just in time (?) to beat a ""timed-out"" dismissal.. This proved to be one of the tipping points in the match## as the last wicket pair then proceeded to show all their preceding batsmen how to make runs## and took the total up to 142## with 42 overs used.</p> <p>Still## 48 overs to score 143 on a decent track## with boundaries even shorter than usual## due to the area in front of the pavilion having been officially designated ""swamp"" and excluded from the field of play## should be easily done. Openers Max Maciver and Sam Phillips got Ballinger away to a slow but steady start## and had 36 on the board before Sam perished LBW. Rollo then entered the fray## and soon had the score moving. At 99 for 3## and only 30 overs gone## Ballinger were cruising. At the same stage Ley Hill had lost 9 wickets! However## Ley Hill's Sri-Lankan (ex Hawridge &amp; Cholesbury) spinner Daluwatte was causing all sorts of problems## and courtesy of a clutch of LBW decicisions where the DRS system## had it been available## might have come in really useful## Ballinger then completely disintegrated## losing 7 wickets for 9 runs## ending with a paltry total of 108. Rollo had looked as if he could have won the game in a canter## and it was unfortunate that his LBW was the most controversial. Daluwatte was the main destroyer## with 6 for 22## but the later batsman had little excuse for their abject performance.</p> <p>Never mind## ""summer"" arrived at long last## the tea was excellent - take a bow## the Thompsons - but we'd rather you were playing## Andy!</p>",,2012-07-23
938,"<p>A combination of a sunny afternoon and the National Trust ambiance of Bradenham's pretty ground## which our&nbsp;1sts&nbsp;had not visited for many a year## gave all present hope that a good game of cricket would ensue - which## in the end## it did. Opting to bat first## Ballinger's top order batsmen looked unlikely to make it a prolonged contest## hell-bent as they were on giving catching practice to Bradenham's fielders. Rollo McIntyre looked likely to produce one of his blistering match-winning assaults## only to join the suicide brigade when he had made a rapid 31. With the score 78 when the 6th wicket fell## in the 21st over## a competitive total looked improbable.&nbsp; An ideal challenge then to Andy ""Bulldog"" Thompson## who dug in and defied the bowlers for more than an hour. In this he was more than ably supported by young Xavier Owen## making his debut for the 1sts. His elegant correct style of batting was a delight to watch. Together they added 55 for the 7th wicket## and after Andy was out for a priceless 40## Ian Maciver (only playing because he was deemed marginally less crocked than the limping&nbsp;Jamie Kellock) launched a late assault on the bowling## blasting an undefeated 31 off 18 balls. Xavier finished on 37 not out## with the 9th wicket having added 47 runs before the innings closed on 187 for 8.</p> <p>In reply## Bradenham were soon in trouble## losing their first two wickets for only 15## with one of them gifted by a comical run-out when the No 3 batsman overbalanced trying to regain his crease. Two stunning catches by Xavier enabled Jack Hankinson to grab a couple of scalps## but thereafter the batsmen became increasingly dominant## being particularly severe on Max Maciver.. However## not for the first time this season## Ewan Webster produced a steady and profitable spell## taking 4 for 21 in his 7 overs. With Bradenham's score on 132 for 7## and only 27 overs gone## the match had definitely swung Ballinger's way. Ian Maciver## conceding only 6 runs off 5 overs## and David Kiddie with 17 off 7 overs## applied such a stranglehold that nine overs later the total had only reached 140. Skipper Davies then## fatally as it turned out## changed the bowling## A spate of wides## and some sensible batting by Bradenham's No 9 and 10 saw them home in an exciting finish## with three balls to spare.</p> <p>So## another match ##from which we should at very worst emerged with a winning draw## cost us valuable points which might well be vital towards the end of the season when we have to face some of the stronger teams.</p>",,2012-07-29
954,<p>Sunshine and no puddles at Balllinger. This is a first for this season. This was also the 2s first match for 4 weeks following two games rained off and a blank week.</p> <p>Skipper Kerry was quietly content with the hand dealt to him by his selection supremo even if there were only 2 players over 18. It looked a reasonably balanced side so when he lost the toss again and was asked to bat he wasn't too concerned.</p> <p>The pitch looked another belter especially as it had had it's final preperation that morning from the groundsman's latest recruit.</p> <p>Max and Monty opened up against some wayward Bradenham bowling and it was difficult to see where the boys were going to score their runs. Eventually Monty reached too far forward and offered some gentle catching practice## Bastie arrived at the crease in a flurry of gloves pads and whirling bats## but his late arrival meant he hadn't been watching and he'd missed that the ball was keeping very low. This meant he missed the first straight ball and was on the way back to the pavilion. Max finally managed to reach one of the endless leg side wides and hit it straight to the fielder## Paul Branigan played on to another shooter## Ben Dugdale was caught brilliantly at point## Jake Cutter got an interesting LBW decision## Dom Brown has gone off injured having been hit by a line drive from the skipper whilst at the non-strikers end ( he didn't get much sympathy)the Skipper fell to another good catch at extra cover##and the innings is in disarray.</p> <p>Then the cavalry arrived in the form of Will Reid(61) and Will Arnold ( 12). These two put on 60 using a mixture of judicious shot selection## some interesting running between the wickets and some good## old fashioned## slogging. Eventually Will A got run out but he was replaced by Dom Brown( 72*) who was detremined to make up for lost time. He and Will R added another 56 before Will was caught and then Josh Badrick (11)helped Dom add another 49 to take the Waggoners to the unbelivable heights of 219 - 9 off 42 overs at which point the skipper declared - Disbelief alround.</p> <p>After a fantastic tea form Fiona Brown the Waggoners took to the field with great purpose. Will Reid opened up and bowled a tidy first over. Josh then had to bowl at the visitors skipper. This gentleman came in at 7 when we played them away so we felt that they weren't going to be that strong. Unfortunately kerry had forgotten what yhe did to us that day which was basically to smash the ball out of the ground at every opportunity. Opening the batting didn't cramp his style in any way and he proceeded to plant Josh into the car-park on a regular basis.</p> <p>Bradenham were cruising. The introduction of debutant Will Arnold had the immediate effect of slowing things down and so did Ben Dugdale from the other end and Ben struck immediately having the skipper caught 2nd ball. Finally the Waggoners had a measure of control but a couple of dropped chances and some interesting wide calling meant they couldn't get the visitors far enough behind the run rate to try and buy a wicket. Ben produced a brilliant bit of fileding to run out the other opener but now they introduced a batter whose favourite shot was the chinese cut. This game was going to the wire.</p> <p>Ben took a really good catch off Dom Brown## Will Arnold was now bowling really tightly and the pressure was mounting on both teams. Finally Will A got his reward when the Bradenham danger man hit a catch to the skipper who## even at his age## would have been upset to drop.</p> <p>Now the charge was on for the Waggoners## could they get the last few wickets before overs or runs ran out. It was close with Will taking 3 wickets in an over but there just wasn't quite enough left for either side to grab the win.</p> <p>A really enjoyable## exciting game and some points on the board at last. The skipper could hear some mutterings from the crowd about the declaration but his timing was perfect.</p> <p>Great fun - well played everyone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2012-07-30

940,"<p>Revenge is sweet. So thought Holmer Green## smarting no doubt from their remarkable debacle earlier in the season## and facing once again their destroyer on that occasion## Max Maciver. But in truth## this match deserved to be billed as The Men (HG) versus The Boys (BWCC)## such was the composition of the Ballinger side## probably the youngest ever to have represented the Firsts.</p> <p>Losing the toss condemned them to a hot afternoon (what a rarity) in the field against the league leaders## but the opening attack of Hamish Sim and Evan Webster started well and contained the powerful HG openers K King&nbsp;and M Watt. However## it was Jack Hankinson who drew first blood## when Ian Davies scooped up a superb diving catch at slip to dismiss King## with the total on 69## and 15 overs gone. Unfortunately that brought to the crease a hitherto unknown (to Ballinger) batsman## by name Hiram Shallow## known to his team mates as Piggy## a dreadlocked Carribbean## who proceeded to scatter the bowling and the fielders to all parts of the field in compiling a violently struck 82 off 16 overs. He and Watt (61) had added 92 for the second wicket before he became Hamish's well deserved victim## thanks to an absolutely blinding catch by Xavier Owen## who shortly afterwards repeated the act in at last&nbsp;getting rid of Watt## who had been badly dropped much earlier. The frenetic pace then quietened down## but only one more wicket fell as HG cruised comfortably to 238 for 4 before declaring with 40 overs gone.</p> <p>50 overs to score to 239 on a good wicket would probably have seriously taxed a full-strength BWCC line-up## but with Joe Hankinson having injured himself in the field## this batting order looked unlikely to cope for long with the best bowling attack in the league. Hope really rested on openers Max Maciver and Andy Thompson## but all too soon Andy was back in the hutch after unluckily playing on## defending a lifting delivery from the pacy D Little. Ian Davies## whose batting form this year (what little we have seen of him ) could reasonably be described as disastrous## then decided that attack was the best policy## and got the scoreboard moving with some risky boundaries## before settling down to watchful defence. Max mis-hooked## dollied a catch## and departed for 18## with the total on 51## whereupon Xavier Owen joined Ian## and was soon playing confidently## in a watchful but authoritative innings. Ian was## unexpectedly## bowled for a well made 41## with the total on 80## and with his departure any real hope of winning became remote##&nbsp;so it was a question of whether the remaining batsmen had the guts to stick in there for a draw. Fortunately Monty Thompson was intent on showing his father that the famed Thompson cussedness was alive and well## and proceeded to defy the bowling for exactly an hour in making an invaluable 14. Xavier also exceeded an hour at the crease for his excellent 24## and thereafter runs became academic as HG crowded the batsmen## using their full range of fast bowlers to intimidate ""our boys"". Evan Webster## not for the first time## was resolute## but with two overs left and the last pair (both Hankinsons) at the wicket## the tension was such that few of the many spectators could tear themselves away to watch the Olympics in the bar.</p> <p>And so the draw was achieved## and high praise is due to the tenacity and application of those responsible - one wonders if some of Ballinger's absent senior players would have been so steadfast in the circumstances.</p>",,2012-08-12

Their progress was steady## but Nick Adams## back from his hols## nicked a couple of wickets. However## a 65 run stand for the third wicket saw the bowlers taking increasing punishment## and although Max Maciver took three wickets the run rate kept accelerating.

966,"<p><!--StartFragment--></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">On a lovely afternoon for cricket Ballinger entertained Missenden Misfits in a game that really lived up to its pretty match billing. A tense and epic contest went to the wire as the away side just scrapped home after Ballinger had looked to have wrestled back the imitative after the Misfits had dominated the opening stages of the match.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">With the sun out and pitch looking excellent## Ballinger won the toss and chose to have a bat on what looked like a peach of a strip. Opening up for the home side was Jamie (5) and Nick (21) who saw off the opening Missenden bowlers with consummate ease as Nick especially looking at home spraying the ball to the boundary at regular intervals. Unfortunately Jamie played at one to many and got caught. Enter financial wonder kid Fally (13) who also looked in good touch## although he missed a straight one just as he looked set to get the scoreboard going. Paul (23) and Tom (17) both added valuable contributions although both can be guilty of not cashing in when they both made decent starts. Thanks to some lower order hitting from Jono (22) and steady support from Stu (12) Ballinger made there way to 177AO at tea which one had to admit looked to be an average score at best## although what was to come may or may not disprove this!</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">After an exceptional teas from the Cutter&rsquo;s## Ballinger set about there task of removing 10 Missenden batsmen and thus winning the game. Easy. Well## easy it was not. Following Monty Thompson&rsquo;s rather controversial run out earlier in the afternoon there was a bit of bite out there in the Ballinger cauldron as Hamish and Jono tour in to bowl against the unfortunate Missenden. Fortunately for the away side the openers held off this initial outburst gradually looked more and more comfortable with Tossell in particular scoring exclusively in boundaries. When he was bowled for 28 Missenden&rsquo;s Lyne and Partridge knuckled down and efficiently began metaphorically chipping away at the target. As Missenden slowly but surely eased there way to the target## Partridge was given out LBW and Ballinger had a sniff. This became more than sniff as Stu and Paul blew away the Missenden middle order making then look very much like Misfits. And so as the game went into the final over## Missenden were 7 down needed only 6 runs. The best Ballinger could do was to claim an honourable draw or even a tie and this looked like becoming reality as the home side really tightened the screw on Missenden restricting them to only 2 runs off the first 5 balls. Unfortunately the last ball of the match however was dispatched to the boundary by the unlikely figure of Lloyd and Missenden had won an excellent match by 3 wickets off the last ball.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">So yes we lost but this match was what Sunday cricket was all about!

They gradually batted us back into the match before Iain fell to the wily Peterson for 18. Ben and the skipper barely troubled the scorer before returning to the hutch. This brought Steve &ndash; back from his 7 week mini break holiday - to the wicket and he helped steady the ship. For some strange reason Rob Mac was applauded for reaching 49 and took that as his cue to depart forthwith. Solid performances from the lower order in particular Freddie helped us accumulate&nbsp; 138 off 43.2 overs## leaving Josh left high and dry for another not out. The score looked reasonable if maybe a few short of a par score.</p> <p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Times;"">Will and Dom opened the Ballinger attack and by the time they had finished their spells it was clear that Ley Hill were going to struggle to get anywhere near our total as their combined 11 overs cost a mere 16 runs and they had removed both openers &ndash; Will clean bowling Walter and then catching Jones at point. Josh then claimed another wicket courtesy of a catch from Ben whilst Freddie was turning the ball sideways from the Wedding Party end. When he removed Peterson due to a replica catch by Will## Ley Hill were 55-4 off 25 overs with little or no chance of winning the game and it became a question of trying to winkle them out. The skipper brought back the opening&nbsp; bowlers and Will claimed three more wickets ## a superb slip catch from Steve and two from Iain at shortish mid off &ndash; one of which he juggled with like a first night waiter kept us in the hunt. Several difficult chances went begging that might have sealed the game but Ley Hill held on for a losing draw at 101-7</p> <p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Times;"">A very satisfactory end to what has been a very damp and disappointing season.

1117,<p>Starting the season against league favourites High Wycombe was always going to be a challenge## especially with many players missing. The visitors &nbsp;put on an impressive 178 with a strong batting performance. Hamish and Dom were best able to curtail the runs against the top batsmen. &nbsp;Will and George bowled pretty well at times. However much our bowling was erratic and there were too many wides - our bowlers&nbsp;need to try and stay calm and develop tactics against very attacking batsmen. Ballinger's reply started with some resolute defense by Hamish and Matt against some fast bowling## plus useful knocks by Greg and Tom. Hamish played an excellent captain's innings for 48 batting through until the 17th over. That over was devastating with a team hatrick for the opponents against some mystifying left arm spin in pretty bad light. It was nearly dark by the time our innings closed on 105-7.

1017,"<p>The 2s first fixture under the new rules was always going to be interesting.</p> <p>Skipper Kerry got off to a good start by wining the toss. What to do? As usual he chose to field first.</p> <p>A useful opening attack of Will Reid and Hamish Sim appeared to be keeping the Lacey Green openers quiet but## although the wicket was playing much better than it looked it had an odd slope to it## which meant the bowlers were struggling to keep the right line. Therefore the Green were being helped by a few extras.</p> <p>Will struck first with a ""jaffa"" and then Sam Peters took his first wicket in senior cricket## thanks to a juggling catch at slip by Steve Conway. Dom Brown then got in on the act &nbsp;and suddenly The Green were 69 -3. Craker then joined opener Janes to put on nearly 80 in just 7 overs. This was achieved with any interesting array of shots. Not many you'd find in any coaching manual. Craker was finaly run out by Ben Dugdale who was also now bowling. There was some debate as to whether this was Ben's worst spell of bowling but somehow## as always## he contrived to take 4 wickets. One thanks to a briliant catch by Will. The skipper wasn't complaining.</p> <p>Will took 2 more wickets including the opener Janes and The Green had been bowled out in just 35 overs.</p> <p>The standard of the Wagoners fielding was excellent with particular praise going to Oliie Cooksey who was outstanding.</p> <p>The father and son combination of Tom and Peter Petrie opened up for Ballinger and were ticking along nicely before Tom missed a straight one. Hamish joined Peter determined to show there's more to his game than just a fast bowler. He did this very well in an excellent stand of 52 before holing out to a good catch in the deep.</p> <p>Steve came and went followed by Peter and it looked all down hill for the Wagoners. Then that boy Cooksie joined the fray and in combination with James Fray## Dom Brown(21)## Sam and Will added another 84 runs taking us to 156 before being bowled with just 4 bals left. It was great to watch.</p> <p>With the draw now out of the equation Balinger were looking for as many bonus points as possible and Ollie kept ticking them off. We ended up with 14 bonus points only 6 behind the maximum for the winners.&nbsp;</p> <p>An enjoyable afternoon spoilt by Lacey Greens insistance that we didnt have a scorer## although Miles was producing yet another master peice from the middle## deducting us a point and making us pay &pound;5 for the privilege.

1102,<p>Against Kingshill's A## this was always going to be a tough fixture and the 44 runs they put on after the only 4 overs gave us a flavour of how difficult it would be. &nbsp;The Kingshill openner is county standard and was able to use the predictable bounce of the astro to smash fours off the best of balls. &nbsp;Harry Doyle was the outstanding bowler with figures of 3 for 17 of 4 overs## a superb caught and bowled and another good pressure catch. &nbsp; Even after the openners had retired## it was clear that Kingshill had depth.

A lucky twisting of Dave Peterson's ankle meant that he was taken off and Dastardy Dennis Mcarthy(6-18) was brought on. Chaos in the Ballinger camp. a Comfortable 98-3 became a very unpromising 101 -7.</p> <p>Skipper Kerry(34) and Matt O'Kelly(18) settled the ship and slowly inched the Waggoners closer and closer to the target. Unfortunately a couple of good overs from the visitors meant that with 2 overs to go 16 were required. A wild swipe from Kerry ended his chance for glory. Rob Farquhar and Matt added another 4 before Matt was caught. A big hit from Rob meant the target was down to 7 with 3 balls to go. A dot ball and then Matt## acting as a runner for the injured Gordon Farquhar## was run out.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A really enjoyable game despite the weather&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2013-05-13
1000,"<p>After their humiliation the previous week## Ballinger badly needed redemption away at Cadmore End. The weather forecast was unfavourable## and there were showers just before play was due to start. A lost toss saw openers Matt Riley(welcome back!) and Andy Thompson having to bat carefully on a pitch that saw the ball both lifting and swinging.. Andy perished rapidly## as did his replacement## skipper Ian Davies. 15 for 2 and Cadmore End well on top. The rot was firmly stopped by the unhurried Riley and the aggressive Carlton Siddle## also making his first appearance of the season. Cadmore End's skipper switched his bowlers around at great speed## but to no avail## as the runs mounted.The 50 partnership had just been reached when Carlton departed## caught## for an invaluable 31. Rollo (who had eventually located the ground after a mega-tour of the Chilterns) came in## hit a 6 into the (very) nearby graveyard## and by the time play resumed after a lengthy search for the ball## his concentration was sufficiently affected for him to misjudge the next ball## and&nbsp;offer a tame catch. 91 for 4## and 24 overs already gone. Next in was young Hamish Sim## who played himself in carefully## displaying some immaculate defensive strokes. This added to the pressure on Matt to keep the scoreboard moving## and he responded in fine style. Hamish sacrificed his wicket to a run out## having batted well## then in came Jono Lacey for his first knock since last ""summer"". With Matt now attacking the bowling with even more violence## and Jono occasionally connecting with impressive effect## the score had reached 174 when Jono fell to a catch off the last ball of the allotted 40 overs## but not before the drama of seeing whether Matt could reach a well-deserved&nbsp;ton.He could have been caught off the penultimate ball of the over## but the chance was spilled on the boundary## and he could only manage a single to end on a tantalising 99 not out. A superlative and finely judged innings.</p> <p>Cadmore End in reply got off to the worst of starts## losing their opener to the very first ball of the innings## bowled by Nick Adams## who was soon revelling in a pitch that was very different from the Ballinger track that had seen their bowlers suffer so badly the week before. With Hamish bowling fast from the other end## the batsmen had few answers until their number five hit a quick-fire 18## comprising three sixes off Hamish ##who had the last laugh## getting him caught off the&nbsp;final ball of his spell. Nick signed off with a masterly analysis of 5 for 20 (thanks Nick## we enjoyed the jug!!)##then Ian Maciver supplied the coup de grace as Cadmore End reeled to defeat in the 24th over for a wretched total of 64 all out.</p> <p>Well played Ballinger## just the way to bounce back.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2013-05-13

class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Ballinger&rsquo;s U14 traveled to a bleak Beaconsfield on Wednesday for their first league game of the season.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Beaconsfield won the toss and inserted the visitors. Ollie Fretton and Gethin Ross opened up for the Waggoenrs and had obviously been feeding on a raw diet of IPL as they flayed around at anything in their half of the pitch This led to some interesting shot selection and execution.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">The fun didn&rsquo;t last for long with Ollie departing with the score on 11. Rob Farquhar followed without troubling the scorer, Gethin shortly after and at 14-3 the Wagoners were in trouble.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Skipper Will Arnold(38) and&nbsp; Scott Bunce(23) now steadied&nbsp; the ship and slowly but surely built a stand of 54 before Scott was run out, Harry McMullan and James Bunce came and went but both helped the skipper add valuable runs. Michael Everett(9) helped Will add another 19 before he then&nbsp; Harri Doyle and finally Will perished in the chase for a few more runs.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">97 looked below par on a decent pitch but the weather was, by this time, foul and the outfield getting slower</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Will and Rob started well for the Waggoners&nbsp; with Will in particular&nbsp; bowling &nbsp;with pace and accuracy but it was&nbsp; the introduction of Scott that started to give Ballinger some hope.

1001,<p>Put in to bat by Waddesdon## Ballinger's openers Matt Riley and Richard O'Kelly##&nbsp;both in good form## were quickly into their stride## and with over a hundred on the board without loss## a sizeable total looked on the cards. But shortly after both completing excellent half centuries they departed## caught## and then the rot set in as wickets tumbled. As usual## Ian Maciver led the resistance## and was undefeated on 17## when the overs ran out## leaving Ballinger with&nbsp;a total of 162 for seven. Credit must be given to the Waddesdon change bowlers## who exerted an increasing stranglehold on the batsmen## and for their ground fielding - though certainly not for their catching## as a hat-full of chances went begging.</p> <p>Following a superlative tea## the Waddesdon innings followed a remarkably similar path to Ballinger's. with their openers scoring freely. However## their opening stand amounted to only 50## before Ballinger got among the wickets## aided by some splendid catching. Notable were a fine one by Andy Thompson&nbsp;grasping a skyer that looked to be over his shoulder## and a vital one by Ian Davies who clung onto a stratospheric offering by Waddesdon's opener## who was threatening to take the game away from Ballinger. An easy win looked in prospect as Ian Maciver (3 for 14 in 10 overs) and Carlton Siddle were in control. However## an unexpected last wicket partnership developed## as Carlton's bowling was seized on## yielding a rapid succession of boundaries## and the Ballinger supporters began to doubt their men. Unjustifiably## as it turned out## as the bowlers wrapped up the innings## with Carlton taking 5 for 50## leaving Ballinger winners by 20 runs.</p> <p>An excellent game## especially for the spirit in which it was played## by both teams.</p>,,2013-05-19
1060,<p>On a very cold windy## &nbsp;evening Chalfont St peter turned up wanting to play cricket. As a horizontal drizzle had started it was agreed to play 10 overs each. The Woggonetts batted first and posted 215## not a massive total to defend.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We fielded really well## kept the bowling tightand kept a constant flow of wickets. with Chalfont St peter needed 2 to win off the last ball the Waggonetts kept their nerve and in their first game in the league recorded a win.</p>,,2013-05-19
1061,<p>Being put in to bat first we slowly accumulated runs and posted a score of 235. It was likely this was not going to be enough. In spite of valiantly playing on in the rain## the game had to be abandoned when the sky was lit up by lightening.</p>,,2013-05-19

Well done.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">HW batted first and Ballinger bowled and fielded very well to restrict them to 86 for 6## not a formidable total at all## on a good wicket and fast outfield. Ballinger opened with Harry Livingstone&rsquo;s left arm swing and Freddie Thompson&rsquo;s wrist spin and had HW 0 for 1 off 2 overs## new county player Moore caught and bowled Thompson. Harry bowed very well with good pace on a quick wicket &ndash; 4 overs for only 11 runs. He then took a really excellent running and diving catch in the deep to dismiss the other opener off Jamie Fulcher (bravely bowling with a damaged quad). But## despite some good pace from Fin Clark (including a well directed bouncer at the HW skipper) HW then built up a partnership until Sharky Iqbal safely took a catch off Thompson in his second spell putting HW at 55 for 3 off 14. Angus Denison-Smith ## bowling very tightly## bowled the new bat - 56 for 4. Ollie Hardman then carried on the good tight medium pace from the same end and picked up a wicket in the 17<sup>th</sup> over - 66 for 5. Michael Everett pouched a catch off Sharky in the next &ndash; 70 for 6 &ndash; but HW got away slightly in the last over to finish on 86.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">New man## James Lewis## looked good but perished to an almighty swing which would have cleared the railway line had he connected!

Thompson holed out in the 9<sup>th</sup> over## leaving Ballinger at 32 for 4## still in touch but with more wickets down than we&rsquo;d have liked. Watchful defence punctuated by lusty blows over mid-off took Jamie Fulcher into double figures## but he was then part of a steady loss of 3 more wickets; so that in the 15<sup>th</sup> over we were 44 for 7## needing another 43 to win. A tall order perhaps## but we had saved some of the best to last in the form of Fin Clark and Angus Denison-Smith## and the other side had bowled out all their best bowlers and had to resort to 2 weaker bowlers for the last 4 overs. Fin and Angus nearly did it for us## both picking the balls to hit and hitting them crisply. But both in the end went aerial once too often and picked the wrong fielders; and Ballinger&rsquo;s late charge faltered at the last hurdle &ndash; all out 12 short with an over left.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">But great credit to all those who turned out## despite illness## injury and exams## including some who have so far been playing for our B team and one new to the club.

1118,<p>We had an unusual &nbsp;side as many U15/14/13 players were away. The&nbsp;visitors batted first and scored heavily. &nbsp; We didn't bowl especially well with too many full tosses and wides## although Hamish was threatening and economical as ever. Chesham's batters took full advantage## especially on the side of the very short boundary## reaching 172-6. A few dropped catches didn't help curtail the runs or run-rate. When Ballinger batted it seemed more difficult## maintly due to more accurate bowling but also with the dazzling sun dipping down. Matt O'Kelly was the standout batsman with a very good 30## showing an array of orthodox shots all round the wicket. Everyone struggled to up the run rate and wickets kept falling at regular intervals as a consequence and we were all out for 81. Disappointing to lose so heavily## but hopefully a learning experience for those who don't always get a chance to bat or bowl and for James (U12) who got a chance to play.</p>,,2013-05-23

1036,<p>The scorecard really speaks for itself on this encounter. A great innings from Ian Davies## supported early on by Basty with his carefully constructed 21 allowing Ian to keep the score moving along at a reasonable rate. A youthful middle order collapse looked to endanger not only Ian's ton but the possibilty of posting a challenging target. Up stepped the captain for the day Ben Dugdale with 9 overs remaning and he looked to take on the bowling from the outset. A quickfire 40 and 75 run partnership with the irrepresable Ian took Ballinger to what looked like a competitive 200.</p> <p>Bourne End took to the middle and Ben with inspired captaincy&nbsp;chose to open with Alex and Stuart## pace and&nbsp;spin. Alex keeping the batsmen under pressure at one end and Stuart rattling through their top order at the other. With relative inexperienced bowling options Bourne End managed to get a foothold in the game. Some erratic bowling and fielding gave the oposition momentum and belief that never looked likely. Back came Alex and Stuart to steady the ship but Bourne End were still in with a shout. A good spell of bowling by Ian complemented his masterful batting performance but it was left to the captain to bowl the last over with 13 runs required. Nerves held and victory was secured on a warm and sunny day.</p>,,2013-05-30
1084,<p>Ballinger at its best.....everyone in the team bowled and contributed to a thoroughly convincing win. Thank you to Theo## Harvey## Max## Henry## Kyle and Will for playing up for the Under11s. You were all fantastic.</p> <p>Philip## Theo and William (Captain) in particular## put on a very steady start with Harvey and Will Jones. I was thrilled to see how eager the rest of the squad were to get out for a bat. William spectacularly signed off with a six. An innings score of 84 looked like it might be a little low## but that was before we saw the fielding and bowling display.&nbsp;</p> <p>The team bounded onto the field## Philip and William giving good direction to their fielders. William## Philip and Will J then bowled some accurate overs picking up four wickets and putting Beaconsfield on the back foot at 26 for 3. Marcus then bowled accurately followed by Will Statham and Kyle who were representing the U11s for the first time. Will## Harvey## Kyle and Henry took over the bowling and supported the team effort fantastically. They all improved as their over went on## and will be brilliant next time they bowl (next overs). Charlotte delivered two good tight overs## and kept the pressure on the other team to score.</p> <p>A brilliant run out from Marcus (at one stump) then broke a stubborn low scoring partnership. The opposition then found it really difficult to score of our attack## and all the bowlers should be proud of this. The last four overs saw some strong return bowling from Philip and William H## with four more wickets being taken## culminating in a fine last ball of the day delivery from Philip to take out the off stump. &nbsp;</p> <p>The real difference was made by some enthusiastic and accurate fielding. Catches were held and returns to the keeper were accurate## but Harvey's work in the big outfield was really impressive.</p> <p>All in all## a really enjoyable game of cricket to watch and all of the boys should be very proud of their victory.</p>,,2013-05-31
1056,<p>A sunny day at home ## Beaconsfield lost the toss and our Captain Oliver Webb chose to field. There were so many outstanding performances with excellent tight bowling throughout the match. With us only giving away 8 leg byes##1 bye## and 16 wides. We took 8 wickets compared to Beaconsfield taking only one of ours. Wickets taken by Oliver 3## Tom 2## and 1 each for Toby## Max Fe and Raphi. We kept Beaconsfield down to 246 runs.</p> <p>Our batsmen started well and that continued throughout the entire innings## our pairs each put on the following Oliver and Max Fe 31## Louis and Freddie Bateson 16## Tim and Casper 34## Toby and Tom 11 and Raphi and Max C 31.&nbsp; Our top individual scores were Oliver 15## Max C 13 and Raphi 12. The boys never looked back and never looked like losing the match in any of their overs ## leaving them with an outstanding score of 317 for only one wicket.</p> <p>The fielding was outstanding with several close run outs and great work by the whole team especially Tim Hayes## Max Fe and Toby.</p> <p>So another comprehensive win by Oliver and the boys##we have a break next weekend&nbsp; and&nbsp;face Chesham on the 16th Away##</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2013-06-02

Longwick brought a strong## entirely adult## team## to face Ballinger&rsquo;s blend of youth and experience; won the toss and decided to bat. George Cooke and Dom Brown took the new ball and an early wicket each## before George pulled up with a sore ankle (recovering from a bad sprain 10 days ago) after 2 overs. Skipper Andy Thompson and then James Fray took over from George## while Dom completed an excellent spell at the other end. But Longwick put together a powerful 3<sup>rd</sup> wicket partnership## assisted by a regular diet of full tosses from various Ballinger spinners. Offspinners Monty Thompson and Stuart MacGowan picked up a wicket each but Longwick were scoring too quickly. So skipper Andy Thompson came back and plugged up one end## ending up with 3 for 13 off 10 overs. Longwick could and should have declared as they passed 200 but chose to bat until 4.30 and 237 for 7 - too many to chase seriously in an hour and 20 overs## at more than 6.5 runs an over## with 5 under 16s in the team. Matt Riley and Nick Tegg started briskly and Monty Thompson (60 not out) then carried on the good work with Matt (46)## but there was never a serious run chase or a serious risk of Ballinger losing 10 wickets. A lost opportunity to set up a proper game of cricket## but all very pleasant in the sun ......</p> </span></p>",,2013-06-03
1020,<p>A Win</p> <p>At last the 2s got their first win under their belt and they did it the hard way.</p> <p>Skipper Kerry won the toss again and having taken one look at a very wet wicket decided that as they prepared it the home team could use it first.</p> <p>As expected it was very slow but Ballinger's double Will attack made sure they kept the ball upto the bat and gave Prestwod's openers few chances to score. Will Reid bowled particularly well without success. Will Arnold was his normal economical self and eventually got his reward.</p> <p>At this point Kerry introduced his secret weapon. Matt O'Kelly. Prestwood had no idea how to cope with his double bouncing long-hops and with the aid of 2 very good catches and one very good ball ended his spell with figures of 3-10. New boy Fin Clarke was now into his stride and again was hitting the right length to bowl on this slow pitch. A good catch in the slips by Steve Conway gave him his first wicket in adult cricket.</p> <p>The 2 Wills now returned to finish off the Prestwood innings with the help of another good catch By Steve and one by Paul Branigan and an excellent run-out by Finn. Prestwood 87-10</p> <p>87 didnt seem many but it had taken the hosts 38 overs to get them and the skipper was concerned. Especially as he and Peter Petrie were now on the injured list.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ben Dugdale opened up with Tom Petrie and they cautiously moved the total to 20 before Ben holed out## Matt came and went## Paul should have wacked it instead of giving catching practice## Tom then made the mistake of running on a miss-field and Ollie Cooksey was all at sea.</p> <p>36 -5 and Ballinger reeling.</p> <p>Will Reid and Steve Conway finally gave the inings some impetus before Steve was out to a chest high full toss - No Ball cried the crowd. The double Will act then took the score to 65 before Will R missed a straight one. Finn then got a first ball. Suddenly Ballinger 65-8.</p> <p>This cant be happening. The skipper then hobbles out to join Will A and is given a very comprehensive breakdown of what's happening by Will. Skipper's response - no quick singles.</p> <p>Will then gets out to a very good catch so 17 still needed when Peter gets to the crease. So we have a knackered knee at one end and knackered back at the other. On receiving his second ball Peter calls for a quick single before realising that neither he nor the skipper would make it. It has to be done in 4s. A couple of excellent blows from Peter and one lusty blow from the skipper get the Waggoners close. One more very dodgy single and then a couple of wides finally get the visitors over the line.</p> <p>A ridiculous game of cricket but very enjoyable and played in excellent spirit and finally with the sun shining.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2013-06-03
1120,<p>Ballinger batted first and put on a useful 100-4. It was very much an innings of two halves as our batsmen struggled upfront against some very accurate bowling with the score only 23-3 after 10 overs. Then Henry## Hamish and Monty mounted an impressive fightback to add 77 off the next 10 overs and build a useful total## including 35 off the last three overs. That showed how an innings and game can change quickly. Great Kingshill got off to a flier when they batted and we quickly lost heart. Monty came on to take the pace off the ball and made a breakthrough but the game ran away quickly not helped by a couple of crucial dropped catches(one very hard) and drooping heads in the field. Disappointing as it should have been a close contest.</p>,,2013-06-06
1105,<p>Batting first## Skipper## Kit## set his team a target of 120. &nbsp;James Gill and Marcus set off after this target with great energy and some very smart running between the wickets against a strong bowling attack. &nbsp;James Gill looked like he would go on to score 30 but fell to a direct hit run-out for 14. &nbsp;Henry King hit 5 boundaries including a 6 to get his 30. &nbsp;Ollie's innings (his best ever) was a master class in stroke play## with a perfect on drive; he also retired at 30## leaving Hugo and Simon to see out the innings - 10 from the last over took our score to just 2 shy of the skippers target: &nbsp;118.</p> <p>This looked defendable and even more so when Will clean bowled their openner with an off cutter on the first ball. &nbsp;After this## Ballinger were ruthless taking a wicket in each of the first 4 overs## with both Ben (2-4) and Will (2-1) bowling excellent line and length. &nbsp;On comes Captain Kit and takes two in two balls - both bowled and Chenies are on their knees. &nbsp;James continued to keep up the wicket / over routine and Kit finished them off with another two in his second over. &nbsp;Kit's figures of 4-3 of 2 overs meant we wrapped up the game after just 7 overs.</p> <p>Such a huge victory surprised me. Chenies were strong on the bowling but Ballinger picked the right balls to hit and blocked the good ones. &nbsp;But it was Ballinger's accurate bowling which made the difference. &nbsp;Well done.</p>,,2013-06-07
1130,<p>Ballinger u17 took to the field for their opening game of the seaon in this league and cup ' double header'. When I say u17## it was actually 1 u17## 4 u16## 4 u15 and 2 u14. Captain Alex Howe won the toss and decided to bat on what looked a good wicket on a beautiful sunny evening. Our top order came and went in fairly quick time without troubling the scoreboard too much against a very good Cublington bowling attack. Ben Dugdale steadied the ship with a solid 32. Will Reid never really got going## which brought to the middle Alex Howe and Kenny Holt with work to do in setting any sort of defendable total. Alex scored a quickfire 17 but it was Kenny who took up the challenge. Obviously benefitting from his work in the nets he crafted a fine 33 not out and put on 48 with Alex taking Ballinger to a&nbsp;respectable 121 for 6.</p> <p>Cublington took to the middle and looked comfortable against Ballingers opening attack of Hamish Sim and Will Arnold who both bowled well without success. Alex Howe took over from Hamish and hit the mark straight away but it was Will Reid at the other end who changed the balance of power. A fantastic spell of bowling taking 4 wickets in 4 overs for 6 runs really put the opposition on the back foot. On came Rob Farquhar who came under attack from&nbsp; Cublingtion&nbsp;needing to up the run rate but&nbsp;managed to pick&nbsp;up a valuable wicket. Inspired captaincy then brought&nbsp;James Fray into the attack at a crucial time## taking a wicket with his first delivery## followed in his next over with two more## a fine catch from Ben Dugdale## rounded off with a brilliant caught and bowled## he finished with 3 wickets for 8 runs off 2 overs. This brought Cublingtons innings to an end as they were a man down still needing 22 runs off 2 overs.</p> <p>A great performance## everyone playing their part. either with bat## ball or in the field.</p>,,2013-06-07
1083,<p>BWCC &nbsp; 108-9 &nbsp; &nbsp; Knottty Green 113-2</p> <p>A brave effort from our team## but we probably let them get away with too many boundaries.</p> <p>Firstly a big thank you to Mathew Jones who once again played up two years for our Under11s. Mathew's bowling and fielding were bang on the &nbsp;money. Congratulations also to Nicau for a really good first game for Ballinger.</p> <p>Having lost four batsman very cheaply## Theo and Elise led a very strong fightback. Both batted with great ability## punishing the bad balls heavily and getting our innings back on track. Theo's retirement then allowed Luke and Will to come in and keep the scoreboard ticking over. Marcus and Mathew were very unlucky to get out very quickly## which left Theo and Charlotte to see us home to the 20 over mark. Theo's innings of 42 not out was littered with good shots and positivity. Well done Theo.</p> <p>Defending the total did not appear to be too daunting## but our fielding really let us down. Normally accurate and sharp## we let too many boundaries get through## and allowed the opposition to build momentum. Our experienced cricketers need to be a bit more alert on placement and technique with our fielders. Learn to adapt to situations if you see a weakness. Elise was the pick of our bowlers with some really accurate overs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plenty to improve on## particularly for the senior players in the team## but well done to ALL of you the kids for a really good try.</p> <p>Sharkey</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2013-06-09

1002,<p>Fot the third week running skipper Davies lost the toss## and Ballinger were asked to bat on a slow## low sticky wicket amidst the picturesque backdrop of the Chiltern Hills and Bradenham Manor.Thompson and O'Kelly provided a cautious but solid start to the innings before Thompson perished on 18.

After consolidating their position## the pair set about picking off the Bradenham attack## and looked to be in a position to post a competitive total before Davies fell## bowled by Ali for 28 with the score on 85. Bradenham's left arm spinner entered the attack and proceeded to run through the Ballinger batsmen## incuding the prized wicket of O'Kelly on 30## and a late order hat trick&nbsp;to finish off the tail. Ballinger ended up on 137 all out.</p> <p>In response the new ball pair of Adams and Siddle looked threatening from the outset## the pitch proving to be equally challenging for the home side## and the Bradenham batsmen looked vulnerable from the outset. Adams struck early with two wickets## and Siddle one from the other end. Unfortunately the clear difference between the two sides lay in the field## with Ballinger putting down at least five clear cut chances that would surely have sealed a win should they have been taken Instead No 3 Gafor went on to score 60 and win the game comfortably for Bradenham.

1124,<p>After winning the toss## catpain Evan Webster decided to bat on an overcast evening with the ground still wet from the afternoon showers. The opening pair of Max Dugdale and Tom McIntyre made a cautious start against some excellent bowling## Max lucky to remain at the crease after being dropped early on. They gradually got to grips with the Gt Kingshill attack and put on 56 before Max was caught going for yet another big hit but not before he'd hit a huge 6 into the pub car park## this after his helmet&nbsp;being smashed the ball before## something he obviously took offense to.&nbsp;His 32 of 21 balls set the innings up nicely. Jake Cutter was next in and a mix up whether to run a quick single saw Tom McIntyre run out the next ball. In came Ben Dugdale with Jake on strike for the 1st ball of the next over only to hear the 'death rattle' as the bails took to the air## a team hat-trick and things now not looking so good. Up stepped Henry Turrell to the crease and looked composed from the start. A partnership of 34 of 5 overs put the innings back on track before Henry was caught for 18. Alex Howe was next up and he and Ben put on a further 35 off 5 overs before Ben was caught trying to up the rate. In came Hamish for the remaining 2 overs and hit a quickfire 14 off 7 balls taking Ballinger to 141 for 5 with Alex unbeaten on 14.</p> <p>Gt Kingshill had a lot to do and lost their first wicket to a&nbsp;great catch from Ben Dugdale off the bowling of Alex Howe without a run being scored.

1003,<p>On the warmest day of the season## Ballinger won the toss and elected to field. All started well## with Evan picking up one of the openers when the score was on 15. Carlton##supporting well from the other end## picked up the next two in quick succession## and at this stage Potten End were struggling at 38 for 3. Carlton bowled out his 10 overs## and after 20 the score was 52 for 3. Maciver then picked up a wicket## but then followed it up with two poor overs and was severely punished by the hard-hittng Hawkridge. This completely changed the tempo of the innings. The skipper then came on and picked up the wicket of Lee who batted patiently for 65. Evan then returned to finish his spell## picking up 4 wickets and finishing with the impressive figures of 5 for 28. Generally the the fielding and catching were good.</p> <p>Ballinger found themselves chasing 172## and never really got going## largely due to an impressive spell by Guerney. Riley went with the score on 18 to a ball that nipped back## Ian followed in the same over to one that kept low. With Carlton going after a brief cameo## and Jamie becoming Guerney's fourth wicket## Ballinger were struggling at 49 for 4. Andy Branigan (batting on one leg) and Jono Lacey then put on 41 until both fell in quick succession. Three more wickets fell quickly with no real addition to the score## and it was then left to Rob Grosse and Evan to give the score some kind of respectability## putting on 31 for the last wicket. Ballinger were all out for 135## losing the match by 135 runs.</p> <p>In truth## a lost opportunity. Whilst we gave them 30 runs too many## overall it was a poor performance with the bat.

1004,"<p>Ballinger suffered their&nbsp;third consecutive league defeat## away to Ley Hill. On paper## a disaster - but not all was doom and gloom## by any means.</p> <p>Having lost the toss## skipper for the day Carlton Siddle led a very young looking Ballinger side out to field## deprived of most of their seasoned regulars through injury or non-availability (holidays?)## on a welcome sunny afternoon. The unfamiliar looking opening attack consisted of Will Reid and Rob Grosse## and they did an excellent job in keeping the Ley Hill batsmen quiet. Will struck first## courtesy of a multi-juggling catch by Fally## but another wicket was not to fall until the score had reached 134## with R Clarke hitting the short boundaries hard and often. One of the few benefits of being short of our ""seasoned regulars"" is that the ground fielding is prone to improve## and this was certainly the case here. Fally took another stunning catch## and generally Ballinger looked pretty efficient as the bowlers toiled on a good batting track. A couple of run-outs at the bitter end saw the scoreboard register 5 wickets down for a final total of 207.</p> <p>With an inexperienced batting line up 208 was always going to be a tough target## and so it proved. The score-board was always well up with the required run rate## with Jono Lacey hitting a powerful 21## but wickets fell all too frequently. Coming in at no. 3## Andy Thompson batted in his customary dogged way to anchor the innings## and started to find the boundary with increasing frequency## including one delightful 6## and his partnership with Carlton (30) looked as if it might win the day for Ballinger## but it was not to be## and when he was shown the dreaded umpiring digit - more than somewhat unjustly some thought - he departed## having made a fine 63## with the total on 157 for 7. The game was really now up## but&nbsp;a spirited last wicket partnership between Ben Dugdale and Will Reid kept us in the match until the 36th over## 31 short of the target.</p> <p>A loss against another team struggling in the league was definitely not what we wanted## but to employ the well-known sporting cliche## there were a lot of positives to take from the match.</p>",,2013-06-11
1106,<p>The difference between the sides was height## bat size and age. A big bat on a fast outfield makes quite an impact. &nbsp;Ballinger's U13Bs are an increasingly confident unit in the field. We bowled more accurately## took more wickets and were tighter and more energetic in the field than the opposition but lacked the big willow to find the boundary as often as they did (6 fewer to be precise). &nbsp;</p> <p>Skipper## Ben## elected to field and openners (Will Fennell and Will Harman) were unlucky not to get wickets. &nbsp;Their length often forcing air shots which did not quite go to hand. &nbsp;Ben and Ollie also bowled tightly earning 3 wickets in their 4 overs and keeping Ballinger hoping to contain Wooburn. &nbsp;Ben again managing a CAB## which seems to be his signature wicket. &nbsp;Max Conway playing no less than 4 years young had a terrific spell of 1-6## our most economical bowler despite bowling off a wicket 2m longer than he is used to. He was also a courageous and effective fielder. &nbsp;Josh Brown seemed to be in the hot seat for fielding and grew in confidence through the match## collecting the ball quickly and with accurate returns eventually leading to one of our run-outs. &nbsp;Marcus## also playing up had a useful spell culminating in a very quick stumping by Michael. Michael's glove work goes from strength to strength - only letting through one bye is the best performance I have witnessed at this age group. &nbsp;He took a smart stumping which he has been threatening to do all season and was sharp on the run-outs. &nbsp;</p> <p>Wooburn's target of 130 was always going to be tough and we never quite got onto the chase. &nbsp;The highlight of our batting was Hugo's 31 retired. &nbsp;Hugo has hinted at this kind of innings for some time - some good aggressive stroke play combined with respectful defensive shots to some good bowling. &nbsp;Ben supported with 15 and Ollie had a cameo 9 off about 6 balls at the end of the innings. &nbsp;I would like to see Ollie put his hand up to open in the next game.&nbsp;</p> <p>Man of the match to Hugo for a great innings. &nbsp;Champagne moment to James Gill for an amazing one handed catch to a ball that was skied over his head.&nbsp;</p>,,2013-06-12

Yeah!&nbsp;</p> <p>We knew that 90 was a defendable target## but it would require some accurate bowling and fielding. We started off like this## with some good tight overs from all of our bowlers. Though Harry and Philip bowled agressively and well## the pick of the bunch were David## Max (yr4)## Ben and Will. These four all took useful wickets and swung the game towards&nbsp;the boys. The Chiltern Girls middle order of Hannah&nbsp;and Charlie## then gave a&nbsp;brilliant demonstration in calling and running## and set real panic into the fielding side. Overthrows## fumbles and dropped catches ensued. The boys then countered with some excellent run outs. This led to 7 runs required off the final over. Four byes....this was Hollywood stuff....one needed off the last ball....another bye.....and a DRAW. Agony and ecstasy.</p> <p>Super stuff with no less than 16 Ballinger CC&nbsp;members involved on the night.

1057,<p>Our skipper for the day Finn Henry won the toss and put the confident Chesham side in to bat. we took a wicket in each of the three first overs which put Chesham under quite some pressure. Finn directed his field with total confidence and rearranged his bowlers to maintain the pressure with Tim Hayes&nbsp;now putting himself forward as one of our strike bowlers&nbsp;and it wasnt until the 10th over before Chesham were in positive territory## this only lasted for three overs after which their score continued its downward spiral. All of the boys bowled really well and this week i have listed all of their efforts as they really warrant publication.

1005,<p>Of all the grounds in the MBL Premier Division where you would least like to play cricket (or umpire or score!)on a cold## wet##windy day##&nbsp;Haddenham would probably get most peoples' vote. Remarkably it was the only ground in the division which saw a result## all the other matches being abandoned to the weather.</p> <p>Ian Davies## returning to lead a greatly strengthened side## performed his customary ritual of losing the toss## whereupon Ballinger were invited to bat first. With rain looking imminent from the outset## it was difficult for the batsmen to decide whether to play as if it were a 40 over innings## or maybe a 20 overs one. Either way opener Riley didn't have to make a decision as he departed in the first over## swiftly followed by Rollo## both adjudged LBW. However## Richard O'Kelly was in fine form from the start## and with Ian Davies giving good support## the score was looking distinctly healthier when the rains came. Play resumed briefly## but the heavens then opened in earnest## with the score on 42 for 2## and 8 overs gone.</p> <p>After a lengthy break and an early tea## during which most of the team revealed their prowess on the darts board or the&nbsp;pool table##&nbsp;the clouds parted## albeit reluctantly## and the match resumed ## shortened to 29 overs each side. Ballinger now faced trying to make a decent total in the 21 overs left to them## and the third wicket partnership continued to thrive until Richard## having just completed a hard-hitting 50 was## surprisingly## bowled. with the total on 72. Meanwhile Ian## who one assumes must have implied to the Haddenham fielders that it was his birthday## continued to profit from dropped catches (three!) until his luck ran out## but not before he had hit a priceless 40## including one mighty six.. The rest of the innings then rather disintegrated## with three run-outs## as the batsmen strove to get a defendable target on the board. 129 for 9 was the outcome## substantially less than had at one time seemed likely.</p> <p>Ballinger's bowlers did not have to wait long for success## Nick Adams striking in his second over## and evidently finding the&nbsp;pitch greatly to his satisfaction.. However## Haddenham were accumulating their runs quite rapidly## and had reached 92 for 4## within easy reach of their target## by the 16th over. Evan Webster swung the match by bowling the hard-hitting Burniston## Nick having already disposed of the dangerous Bharath for 41.Nick completed his 10 overs with the superlative figures of 6 for 32## and Evan finished with 3 for 27## as Haddenham subsided from 92 for 4 to 109 all out## leaving Ballinger victorious by 17 runs.</p> <p>This was a gratifying performance## after a run of defeats## moving Ballinger a welcome couple of places up the league table## and a triumph for all concerned in the match## considering the miserable weather conditions.</p>,,2013-06-16
1098,<p>Reduced to 15 overs a side## due to the late finish of the Beacon v DCGS match in the afternoon.&nbsp; Ballinger 92 for 6. Superb opening platform from Joe Turrell (retired for 30## continuing recent top form as opening bat) and&nbsp;Fin Clark (run out for 21); and then some lusty hitting at the end from George Cooke (20 not out).&nbsp; Tight bowling from Freddie Thompson## Tom Petrie## Fin and George## and generally good ground fielding## kept Chesham behind the rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;With&nbsp;3 overs to go they had 28 to get. Harry Livingstone and Max Leane&nbsp;bowled&nbsp;2 tight overs## leaving Chesham 18 to get off the last over## bowled by Harry.&nbsp; Excellent clean striking from Chesham's Nouman Aslam left them with&nbsp;4 to win off the last ball## despite all Ballinger&nbsp;men being on the fence.&nbsp; But Harry kept his head## as did George on the boundary## keeping Chesham down to&nbsp;2 runs## leaving them&nbsp;1 short## on 91 for 4.&nbsp; A very exciting game of cricket## played to a very high standard## in an excellent competitive spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,2013-06-17
1039,<p>Captain Matt Riley won the toss and decided to bat on an overcast afternoon with a light drizzle falling. He was probably questioning his decision 3 balls later as an uplayable delivery nipped back of the wicket and clipped his bails. Max Dugdale was next in looking to build on his recent improvement in form. Basty found it difficult to get going and it was left to Max to move the innings on. He made an excellent 52## including five fours and 3 sixes## the partnership putting on 75 in 16 overs before Max took on the bowling once to often. 75 for 2 quickly became 85 for 5 before Steve Conway and Tom McIntyre put on a useful 38 of 10 overs before Tom holed out to a good catch at mid wicket. The weather was improving but unfortunately not the batting. Steve Conway pulled up lame and the decision was to either put him down or get him a runner. Ben came out as his ' body double' and the three of them put on another 10 runs before Steve fell to a good delivery. Tea was fast approaching and Ballinger managed to get to 159 before George Cook was run out with 1 ball remaining.</p> <p>The sun was now shining and the wicket drying quickly. After an excellent tea Missenden took to the middle on what looked a much better wicket. Captain Riley decided to go for youthwith anopening attack of George Cook and Freddie Thompson## pace and spin. They both bowled really well without any luck as the openers put on 72 for the first wicket. 72 for 1 was soon 81 for 2 but the problem of youth and bowling spin meant that Ballinger were rattling through the overs. 21 gone and the clock stricking 6pm gave Missenden 20 overs to get 78 runs with wickets in hand. However## excellent bowling kept the run rate down. It came down to the last 2 overs with 9 runs needed. It was down to Ben Dugdale to bowl the crucial penultimate over and he kept his nerve## conceding only 2 runs and taking a key wicket. Over to Stuart McGowan## a wicket with his first ball and 7 still needed. Unfortunately## Chris Kaye## who had opened was still there to guide Missendenover the linewith 1 ball to spare.</p> <p>Ballinger lose by 5 wickets## but a thoroughly enjoyable game## played in great spirit on what turned out to be a beautiful afternoon.</p>,,2013-06-17
1113,<p>This will be a short as the match was. 21 overs instead of 40.</p> <p>With no Ballinger batsman making double figures on a decent track against an average bowling attack it's difficult to know what to say. 48 was never going to be enough and Marlow made very short work of reaching their target.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hey Ho off to The Lee next</p>,,2013-06-18
1125,<p>The least said about this game the better. Over confidence and complacency can often come back to haunt you and this game was no exception. Asked to bowl Ballinger soon had Aylesbury in trouble&nbsp; at 19 for 3 off 7 overs. Enter complacency and the score becomes 67 for 4 off 14 overs. Introduce over confidence and a little arrogance and the score finishes on 117 for 6.</p> <p>Over confidence and arrogance take to the middle and soon it is 11 for 3 off 3 overs. Harry Bartlett who for technical reasons is represented on the score card as Josh Badrick realises that this might not be quite as easy as imagined and anchors the innings with partnerships of 17 with Kenny Holt and 49 with Jake Cutter taking the score to 77 for 5 off 13 overs&nbsp;before falling to a good delivery. Jake Cutter is batting well at this time and is joined at the crease by Ben Dugdale with 41 runs still needed off 7 overs with the Aylesbury team in confident mood. Tight bowling kept the run rate down an Ballinger needed 23 off the last 3 overs with the Aylesbury opening bowling attack back in action. Backs to the wall and defeat a real possibility in a game that should never have been in doubt see Jake and Ben hit 9 off over 17## 14 off over 18 and 12 off over 19## Jake finishing the game with a huge 6 into the nearby tennis courts.</p> <p>Victory from the jaws of defeat## all of their own making with lack of focus## sloppy fielding## bowling and batting. Hopefully## lessons learned.</p>,,2013-06-18

1006,<p>Skipper Davies## apparently still intoxicated by a combination of the Lions' victory plus the after effects of the Golf Day Dinner## and having actually won the toss ( a rare event)## threw caution to the winds and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch## even though his batting line-up lacked a little in depth. Thereafter## things went sharply downhill for him## and the team. After 14 overs the scoreboard registered 4 wickets down for a mere 16 runs## nine of which were wides! This abysmal performance was the result of excellent fast bowling by Little (whose 10 overs cost 11 runs)## and Germain who ended up with 5 for 19## combined with a death wish by our star batsmen Rollo (caught first ball) and Davies (caught 4th ball). Opener Jamie Kellock despatched Germain for an imperious cover driven boundary in his first over## before registering 36 consecutive dot balls in the book## and lasting an hour at the crease in an impressive defensive effort. The arrival of Carlton Siddle arrested the impending debacle## and he saw the total reach 45 before he was bowled## and 21 overs gone. However## there followed a 67 run partnership for the 7th wicket between Fally and Adeel Iqbal. Both unsurprisingly started nervously but they grew in confidence## Fally scoring mainly in powerful boundaries## while Adeel showed some delightful cut shots and placed the ball well. Fally departed## bowled## having top-scored with 39## with the total on 112## and Adeel (30) a couple of runs later. Normal service now&nbsp;resumed and the innings collapsed to leave Holmer Green a pretty tame target of 119.</p> <p>Ballinger's bowlers started well. Will Reid gained a contentious LBW decision in his first over against the prolific Watt## and Nick Adams struck soon afterwards to see Holmer Green 17 for 2. That## though## was as good as it got## as the batsmen were soon scoring freely. A couple of sharp chances went down## which didn't help## and the pitch seemed to have quietened down. Max Dugdale took a smart stumping chance in an encouraging display behind the stumps## and Carlton picked up a couple of late wickets to lend a modicum of respectability to the scoreboard## but in truth this was a disappointing effort against a clearly better side.</p>,,2013-06-23
1126,<p>Ballinger lose by 8 wickets but what might have been? Ballinger lost the toss and were asked to bat on a sunny evening&nbsp;on what looked a decent wicket. Max Dugdale soon set about the Dinton attack and put on 53 for the first wicket in the sixth over. Hamish Sim joined Max at the crease and the pace didn't let up## the pair putting on 76 in 9 overs before Max fell on 89## caught at deep mid wicket going for yet another big hit. The score on 131 for 2 after 15 overs. Then the collapse losing 6 wickets and only adding a further 23 runs. Was this going to be enough?</p> <p>Captain Evan Webster decided to mix pace with spin as the opening attack with Jake Cutter bowling with the sun behind him. It's a fine line when trying to flight the ball to a good length and some over pitched deliveries were severely treated. Monty Thompson suffered the same fate and Dinton were soon up with the required rate with wickets in hand. After 15 overs they were on 133 for 2## 2 runs ahead of Ballinger at that stage of the game. Their opening bat was now closing in on his 100 and set about the Ballinger bowling and finished the game off with 3 overs remaining## unbeaten on 110## a great innings.</p> <p>Lessons to be learned ..... must finish off the innings when in a great position ....... must bowl better line and length when defending a decent total ...... must be sharper in the field and not gift runs to the opposition.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2013-06-25

1132,<p>Having been put in to bat by High Wycombe it&nbsp;was important to get off to a solid start in what was going to be a difficult encounter. Unfortunately the first ball of the innings## unplayable## skittled Max Dugdale's stumps.

Change of bowlers did not lessen the quality and Ballinger found themselves 49 for 7 off 13 overs. Dom Brown and Will Reid put on a gallant 33 before Dom fell to another great delivery. Ballinger finishing on 91 for 9 off their 20 overs.</p> <p>High Wycombe obviously thought this would not be a problem to chase down and sent in some lower order batsmen to open their innings. However## excellent bowling from Alex Howe## Will Reid and Will Arnold held the visitors to 31 for 1 off 9 overs. Dom Brown joined the attack and HW found themselves 42 for 2 off 12 overs.

We then began to struggle until Marcus and Henry began to stop the wickets and rebuild## but they were now up against a climbing run rate. Boundaries became a rarity and shots to well placed fielders deterred us from taking singles. GKCC bowling was overall much straighter## so the extras column did not come to our aid either.</p> <p>All in all## I think we were all disappointed not have given a better account of ourselves.</p> <p>Well done boys and girls## let's go out with a bang on Sunday at Chalfont St Giles.</p> <p>JS</p>,,2013-07-05
1024,<p>Captain Ben Dugdale won the toss and chose to bat on what looked a good wicket on this beautiful sunny day. It was obviously too hot for several of the top order who decided to gift their wickets and retire to the shelter of the clubhouse. It was left to Stuart Clark and Iain McLoughlin to try and get the innings back on track. The pair put on 73 before the heat got to Stuart who hit across the line to a straight delivery. In came Oli Cooksey and a 23 run partnership with Iain took the score to 111 before Iain nicked one to the keeper## a solid innings of 59. Phil White## who for technical reasons appears as Sam Phillips on the score card## never got started and was&nbsp;out LBW. The score now at 116 for 7 after 32 overs and things not looking good. In came Dom Brown## back after injury## and he set about the Lacey Green bowling. A partnership of 66 with James Fray and finishing on 54 not out took the Ballinger total to a respectable 183 for 7 off their 40 overs. It still looked on the light side given the conditions but at least a total to defend.</p> <p>Lacey Green took up the challenge and good bowling from the youthful Ballinger attack made it diifficult for the visitors who were 40 for 3 off 10 overs. A partnership of 50 for the next wicket took the score to 90 for 4 off 18 with their number 3 bat established at the crease. Ballinger had limited bowling options with James Fray not feeling well and unable to bowl and the captain having to juggle his youthful team. Another good partneship of 56 for the next wicket took LG to 148 for 5 off 28## well ahead of the rate## wickets in hand and their number 3 still in control. Some erratic bowling made it all too easy and LG chased down the required total with 9 overs remaining.</p> <p>A deserved victory on a very hot day## spoilt in part by the attitude of certain players and officials......let's put it down to the weather.</p>,,2013-07-07
1008,"<p>Another lost match for Ballinger## but in an exceptionally low scoring game they came within a whisker of snatching victory. Acting skipper Ian Maciver## having bucked the usual trend by winning the toss## opted to field first. Nick Adams and Will Reid were soon into their stride## with Nick securing the first of his four wickets when Monks Risborough had reached 12 in the 5th over. Evan Webster then entered the attack## starting with two consecutive wicket-maiden overs. By the end of his spell he had taken 5 for 20 as the wickets tumbled## and at 59 for 9 Monks Risborough were looking done for. However## their 10th wicket partnership then proceeded to put on 29 priceless runs by dint of intelligent batting and a match-turning negative decision by their umpire for&nbsp;a smart piece of O'Kelly stumping off Hamish Sim's bowling. Both Hamish and Adeel Iqbal bowled well towards the end## but when Adeel bowled his namesake Iqbal to wrap up the innings in the 35th over## the final total of 88 looked## surely## hardly a mountain to climb. But the fact that it was so low was heavily influenced by the extremely slow outfield which restricted boundary scoring to the extent that the total was realistically worth nearer 130.</p> <p>Ballinger had to face 5 overs before tea## during which they rapidly lost Nick## promoted by the skipper to give him greater batting time## for a duck. As a past winner## albeit lost in the mists of time## of the club batting prize## Nick's time will surely come again! After tea## Richard and Rollo proceeded encouragingly&nbsp;well## and the match was beginning to look safe&nbsp;until Rollo perished to a blinding catch in the&nbsp;deep## which on most other days would have gone to ground. 30 for 2 rapidly became 57 for 8 as a succession of batsmen failed to cope with hostile bowling on a somewhat unpredictable pitch and a cacophony of noise from the fielding side## who## sensing an unlikely win became more than a little over-excited (well## by BWCC's sedate and gentlemanly standards## anyway). Standing firm amidst the carnage was Jamie Kellock## coming in at No 6## batting for nigh on an hour for his excellent 17 before falling to a catch by the keeper (- and he walked## instantly). An equally obdurate partner was Evan## who complemented his splendid bowling performance by&nbsp;also resisting for nearly an hour## and remaining unbeaten with 15. Partnered at the end by Will Reid## the pair looked as if they might emulate the Monks Risborough 10th wicket stand## but with 3 overs left## and only 4 runs required for victory## Will directed an otherwise admirable hook-shot straight at square leg## who gleefully held it## and was mobbed by his team mates in a scene reminiscent of the Lions' supporters in Sydney## or indeed the crowd on ""Murray Mount"".</p> <p>Compared with last week's wretched display this was a really good performance## especially by the young players in the team## who all contributed well## and it also gave Rob McIntyre his first experience of&nbsp;1st XI&nbsp;League cricket## which appeared to leave both him and James quite unfazed.Also impressive was the shrewd handling of the field-placings.

1042,<p>This beautiful sunny Sunday was overshadowed with the awful news that one of the Hyde Heath team due to play in this match had died suddenly in the week## having played the previous Sunday. At the age of 46 he leaves a wife and daughter. There was a minutes silence before the game in his memory.</p> <p>Captain Nick Tegg won the toss and decided to bat on what looked a superb wicket. The game understandably got off to a subdued start with both teams coming to terms with the situation. Nick Tegg was the first to go with the score on 29 with Max Dugdale at the other end looking in good form## stroking the ball about in controlled fashion. Basty was next in but never got going and was bowled without troubling the scorer. Monty Thompson was next to join Max and both looked very confident before Max fell to another great delivery. In came Hamish who also looked to appreciate the conditions. Monty was the fourth wicket to fall to another great delivery## all four batsmen bowled by Foster with his controlled left arm swing. Toby Lyons## making his Sunday debut##&nbsp;out without scoring. Ballinger now 86 for 5 off 23 overs and in need of inspiration. In came Jake Cutter who took up the challenge going on to make 43 off 32 deliveries before mistiming a full toss straight back to the bowler. Dom Brown and Matt OKelly went cheaply and it was left to Ben Dugdale and Alex Howe to get Ballinger to a respectable 187 for 9## putting on 49 off the final 8 overs.</p> <p>After a pleasant but rather expensive tea Hyde Heath took to the middle in confident mood with the opening pair looking to take on the Ballinger bowling. With the score on 33 off 6 overs Dom Brown deceived the left handed Haddock and the whole of the Ballinger team with a wonderful slower&nbsp;delivery out of the back of his hand## one to live in Ballinger folk lore. Unfortunately## this momment of magic did not manage to slow the scoring and Hyde Heath raced to 112 off 18 overs before Monty Thompson deceived the opening bat and Max Dugdale taking a very sharp stumping. With the score on 121 off 20 overs it was the same combination## Monty deceiving the bat and Max quick to remove the bails. Hyde Heath now needing 67 runs from the remaining 18 0vers. Wickets from Jake Cutter and 2 from Ben Dugdale kept things interesting but with wickets to spare Hyde Heath managed to chase down the required runs with 4 overs remaining.</p> <p>A great game## played in great spirit under a cloudless sky but under the darkest of circumstances.&nbsp;Credit to all involved.</p>,,2013-07-08
1127,<p>Captain Evan Webster won yet another toss and chose to bat on what looked a good wicket on yet another beautiful sunny evening. What could possibly go wrong? Well at 15 for 3 off 6 overs it appeared to be the batting. Good opening bowling on an unpredictable wicket had Jake## Max and Hamish back in the pavilion in quick time. Ben Dugdale and Alex Howe resumed their Sunday unbeaten partnership and put on 34 off&nbsp;5 overs before Alex was trapped LBW. Kenny Holt didn't stay long which brought Toby Lyons to the middle in his first appearance for the under 17's. He put on 17 runs in partnership with Dom Brown and a further 19 with Will Reid and finished on 23 not out off 24 deliveries## taking Ballinger to 110 for 7 off their 20 overs. Not bad considering but was it going to be enough?</p> <p>CSP took to the middle in confident mood but excellent bowling from Alex Howe and Will Reid soon put an end to that. CSP found themselves on 7 for 4 off 5 overs. Rob Farquhar and Hamish Sim were next on and the quality of the bowling remained at a high level not giving the opposition any easy runs. The next wicket fell at 48## a great delivery from Hamish## the next at 48## another great delivery from Hamish and the next at 48## a good catch from Evan Webster off Will Reid's final over. Ben Dugdale and Dom Brown joined the party and both took wickets. Ben&nbsp;tempting the batsmen out of his crease for Max to remove his bails. CPS finishing on 70 for 9 off their 20 overs.</p> <p>Great effort by the boys## good to have batting ability through the order and with the excellent bowling options available we're always in with a shout. On to Ley Hill for the league decider.</p>,,2013-07-10
1128,<p>A beautiful sunny evening## the league title still a poosibility## captain Evan Webster winning the toss yet again and deciding to bat## thinks we're looking good and the boys in confident mood. Max Dugdale cautiously looks at the first delivery## then&nbsp;middles the second## cover dives and puts out his right hand and miraculously holds on to the ball. Max walks off in disbelief and on comes Hamish Sim much earlier then hoped. He and Jake Cutter get the innings back on track before Jake has a moment of madness and calls for a run that was never on. Ben Dugdale up next with the score on 41 for 2 off 6 overs. Another decent partnership develops before Hamish holes out to mid off 76 for 3 off 14. In comes Dom Brown## out goes Ben Dugdale holing out to the same shot as Hamish. Will Reid to the middle with Ballinger in need of salvation. Over 16 sums up the game so far: . W 1nb-1 . W W 1wd 1wd . 3 wickets## 4 byes## 1 run. Ballinger 85 for&nbsp;6 soon becomes 88 for 7 off 17. Will does his bet to inject some life into the innings and finishes on 16 not out off 12 balls with Kenny Holt falling to the last ball of the innings. Ballinger 108 for 7 off 20 overs. Surely not enough even with our bowling options.</p> <p>Ley Hill take control early and push the score to 52 for the first wicket off 8 overs## a sharp stumping by Max of Jake Cutters leg spin. Another quick wicket## the dangerous Joe Batt## well caught by Connor Underwood of the bowling of Ben Dugdale offers some light but this is short lived with some&nbsp;erratic bowling and fielding allowing the opposition to get to 96 off 14 overs before James Fray takes a good catch off Evan Webster's wicket maiden over. Sadly too little too late as Ley Hill reach the required total with 4 overs remaining.</p> <p>No league title## no longer the holders of The Ley Hill Challenge Cup## not this season anyway. We'll be back!!!!</p>,,2013-07-13
1009,<p>On a scorching hot afternoon Richard O'Kelly was asked by his team mates to toss up## since Ian Maciver had failed to make the 1.15 deadline. Cadmore End's skipper called correctly## thus condemning Ballinger to an arduous stint in the field## where## unlike the previous week at Monks Risborough## the outfield was lightning fast and bumpy## and the pitch another Kellock gem.</p> <p>With a near full-strength side for a change## the extra maturity in years and experience was somewhat offset by an occasional lack of athletic fielding on the boundaries## redeemed by superlative work from Will Reid whose chasing and diving were admirable## plus the usual excellent fielding by Jono Lacey. An injury to Evan Webster meant that after taking a wicket in his first over## he had to come off## after his three overs had cost 25 runs. Nick Adams was his customary economical self## his ten overs yielding a mere 35## with one wicket## and had several other half chances flash through the slips. A partnership of 69 for the 4th wicket was broken by Carlton Siddle when he bowled J Ahmed for 56## but the scoreboard could barely keep pace when M Luqman scored 31 off 12 balls## including 4 sixes## largely at the expense of the luckless Andy Thompson## and the run rate rose to 6 an over. Ian Maciver weighed in with four wickets towards the end## albeit expensive ones## and Cadmore End assisted with three run-outs## gratefully accepted. Richard kept a clean sheet behind the stumps## with no byes## and was visibly furious with himself when missing a sharp stumping chance. A final total of 229 meant that certain Ballinger batsmen might have to forget recent poor form## and take advantage of the friendly pitch and fast outfield.</p> <p>Such expectations often mean that the batsmen chance their arms all too early## but Matt Riley and Richard## as the in-form batsmen this season## set about their task in exemplary manner. After a circumspect start both were soon scoring freely## and so confident were they## against an increasingly silent and dispirited fielding side (the start of the Ramadan fast perhaps contributing) that it started to look as if Ballinger might achieve a ten wicket victory. But with the stand worth a mighty 172## Richard was caught for a superlative 85## and in the 35th over and the total 197## Matt followed## only 12 short of a deserved ton. The big question was now whether the asking rate could be maintained. Rollo went on the attack immediately## and was unlucky (yet again!) to be held in the deep for a quick-fire 17## whereupon there followed a clatter of wickets as 204 for 2 became 215 for 6## the fielding side recovered their voices## and finger nails began to be chewed in the pavilion.To the rescue came the cool head of Andy Thompson## who finished with a blaze of boundaries## to see Ballinger home with an over to spare (- it appears## as the scorers## affected by excitement and unaccustomed heat## had by this time temporarily lost the plot!).</p> <p>An exciting end to a good match## and a result desperately needed if we are to avoid the spectre of relegation.

The temperatures up in the 30s## children are cooling off in the river## the pitch looks good and the skipper manages to lose the toss. Not a happy team did he lead out onto the vast acres.</p> <p>Dom Brown and George Cooke opened up for the Waggoners and George in particular was quickly into his stride but the first wicket fell to a brilliant bit of fielding by Sam Peters when he ran out one of the Hill's openers. George then cleaned up the other. Then it was time for change and on came Sam to replace George and Tom Petrie to replace Dom. Sam struck in his first over and then Tom had danger man Petrie dropped off his first ball. How costly would that prove as he was going along really well. Not a problem for Sam though when he removed his middle stump next over.</p> <p>The home team were scoring at about 4 an over but it was difficult to work out what a decent score was gong to be as the pitch wasnt quite as quick as it first looked.</p> <p>Tom got his reward in the next over## then it was all change with Tom going to 'keeper and Freddie Thompson coming on to bowl with Ben Dugdale at the other end. Ben took a wicket with his second ball and Freddie in his second over. Chris Jones had now started to strike the ball well for the Hill and looked like he could take the game away from the Waggoners but a liitle teaser from Ben was too much tempatation and he fell for a well struck 32.</p> <p>With the score on 104## 8 down and still 13 overs to go Ballinger were thinking about an early tea and lots of overs to use but two of the Hill's youngsters soon changed that plan. James Woodley and Max Lee added an excellent 33 runs before the returning Dom managed to get Jamie to hole out to Freddie. George was now back on and quickly removed the last man.</p> <p>We bowled and fielded well and. although we&nbsp;had been refreshed by drinks every 10 overs everyone did really well not to wilt under the blazing sun.&nbsp;</p> <p>Derek Richards and Tom opened up for the Waggoners with the comforting words from the skipper that ""they havent got anyone quick"". Unfortunately he hadn't come across the Petrie twins before. They were both quick and hostile. Derek and Tom did brilliantly to survive and slowly but surely Derek found his timing and the pair added a very handy 32 runs before Derek perished caught behind. Bastie didnt last long## Steve Conway looked a million dollars for 8 balls then Mat O'Kelly joined Tom and they patienty put on 29 for the 4th wicket. Tom fell in the 29th over for only 19 but## by occupying the crease and helping others keep the score board ticking over he'd done a brilliant job.</p> <p>By now we'd all realised that this wasnt the easiest pitch to bat on and the Hill bowlers were making sure that it was as hard as possible.</p> <p>Dom Brown got away with a very easy drop catch only to try and repeat it 2 balls later with a different result. This brought Ben to the crease and his rapid 25 off 16 balls changed the game completely. Annoyingly he got out with still 22 required and 7 overs left ( By now we were very grateful for the extra 2 overs we got for bowling the Hill out). Sam Peters hadn't troubled the scorers and Matt had finally gone for a well played 20. Skipper regarded this as his best innings for the club so far. Freddie and George added another 8 before Freddie was briliantly caught by Max Lee the Hil's 'keeper. This meant that the skipper had to don his pads and join George.</p> <p>14 required 5 overs left. George patiently working the singles whilst the skipper is trying to work out how to bat. 4 overs 11 required## 3 overs 10 required## 2 overs 9 required## &nbsp;last over 7 required. Wily old pro Peterson to bowl it to George. Dot ball## wide## dot ball## a single and now there are 100 years of experience facing each other. Who is going to crack. A straight ball and the skipper finds the middle of his bat and manages to hit it for 4. The scores are tied. A very lenient umpire doesnt give the next ball as wide down the leg side. This is it## last ball.</p> <p>The skipper cant believe it when the ball is so wide outside the offstump he cant reach it and the Waggoners have won a realy good game of cricket.</p> <p>A great day and well done to both teams for coping so well with the heat. As always played in the right spirit.</p>",,2013-07-15
1122,<p>We finally managed to play this rearranged game on a sun-drenched evening (July 15th) at the picturesque Cookham Dean ground.</p> <p>Ballinger batted first and were tied down to 30-2 in the first eight overs against some tight bowling. From then on## Dominic and Hamish started smashing the ball all round the ground with Dom playing the aggressor and Hamish the anchor as both scored excellent 50's. Toby## Sam and Rob also joined in the batting fun as the boys reached a commanding total of 162## their highest score of the season.</p> <p>Cookham Dean started well and looked like they would mount a challenge. Their runrate was averaging eight per over off the first eight overs. Then Ballinger seized control with some tight bowling## wickets and committed fielding. Dom's and Rob's bowling was excellent and accurate as they clean bowled five of the top order with Dom making the early breakthroughs. Dylan and Scott also picked up wickets## and then James and Harry both enjoyed a chance to bowl the final overs as Ballinger closed in on an impressive win. Matt's keeping was impressive despite the variable bounce## while Sam took an excellent catch in the deep and ground fielding was excellent on a super-fast pitch and outfield.</p> <p>I really like the intensity## commitment &nbsp;and team spirit Ballinger showed in the field. Dom captained well and played an all-round Man of the Match performance. It was pleasing to end a tough league season on a high with a good victory where everyone got a chance to contribute.</p>,,2013-07-16

and a choice of two great strips, everything was set for an enjoyable game against one of the division&rsquo;s more affable teams. Our team once again gutted to augment the holidaying first team, and with skipper Kerry very much looking forward to a trip to Colchester it was a much changed side with lots of known unknowns in it. Lulled by the overhead cloud cover, stand in Skipper Branigan won the toss and, envisaging a leisurely afternoon in the cool conditions, stuck Waddesdon in.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">First over completed, a peach of a ball from Rob Farquhar moving back through the gate and Waddesdon 5 for 1, what&rsquo;s not to like?&nbsp; Hmm. Two fairly wayward opening 4 over spells completed, the sun beating down, the oppo on 67 without further loss and the frustrated Kerry whispering advice from the scorers hutch it suddenly didn&rsquo;t seem quite so pretty! A measure of control was needed, so a change of pace was called for &ndash; quicker at one end courtesy of Sam Peters whilst from the Pavilion End Monty Thompson weaved his off spin. A couple of very difficult chances went begging, whilst a faint nick of Sam was snaffled by Freddie Thompson behind the stumps but ignored by batsman and umpire alike. The 15<sup>th</sup> over saw an end to the second wicket partnership as the scenario was repeated and the roar from the Ballinger fielders proved too much to ignore this time, but by now they had reached 96 of the first 15 overs. Monty continued to restrict the score, whilst Sam was replaced by James Fray at the Football Stadium end. Drinks &ndash; thankfully! 124 for 2 off the first 20, Monty&rsquo;s spell nearly finished and bowling options limited. The Skipper had a few things to sort out. The athletic Steve Conway was summoned and sent to the Pavilion to emerge Prior-like in pads and gloves &ndash; increasing the bowling attack by one even if Waddesdon were to be deprived of Conway&rsquo;s magic with ball !</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A crucial passage of play then ensued with James finding a better line and length, a despairing diving chance was spilled by the skip, who was relieved and reprieved 2 balls later thanks to a fine catch out on the mid wicket boundary by Sam, and the dangerous looking Grantham was back in the hutch. By the 30<sup>th</sup> over, they were down to well below six an over but still only 3 wickets down. Time for the leg spin of the younger Thompson. Runs continued to accrue but now all of a sudden wickets started to tumble too. The highlight was an outstanding catch in the deep from Nick Peters capping off a fine fielding display on his debut. Sam dismissed Edwards for 80 with a surprise full bunger which he mysteriously declined to smack to the boundary and Ballinger could suddenly smell wickets. Thompson ran through the tail with a ruthlessness one expects from a cricketer bearing that name, and soon had 4 wickets to his name. Showing the trust in his older brother, that one likes to see from the youngest, he directed Monty to the long on boundary and told him to prepare himself. Two spilled catches later, followed by a run out of their last man &ndash; Andy would be proud of the brazenness of the family jug avoidance! 232 all out of 39.5 overs &ndash; a mighty score but it might have been a lot more and on that track there was always a chance.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A fine tea from Veronica saw the Ballinger team in better spirits (well maybe not Monty who already feared the family dinner table as Freddie retold the story for the nth time).</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ballinger needed a solid platform and so turned to the dependable Derek Richards as opening partner to Monty. A surprisingly brisk start set the right tempo before Derek perished with the score on 24 . Monty was joined by Basty and the runs continued to flow (boundaries mainly as neither seemed too keen on that tiresome chore of actually running between the wickets). Basty was back in the Pavilion with score on 57 but at least we were scoring freely. Out strode Nick Peters, on debut, could his batting match his earlier fielding? At the other end Monty was piling on the pain and had soon accumulated 50 &ndash; maybe he&rsquo;d have some ammunition for that dreaded family get together after all. What followed could only be called a dismantling of the Waddesdon attack that used 7 bowlers in an attempt to shore things up. By drinks we were well ahead of the required rate as the batsmen hit the ball to all parts of the ground, Monty mainly through the covers and straight down the ground, whist Nick was more mid wicket and third man!</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Monty spent a while in the nervous nineties before finally reaching a fine century, his first, before generously deciding to give someone else a chance and departing for 101, with the game in the bag. Steve Conway joined Nick, who by this stage had reached his 50, and Ballinger cruised to victory by 7 wickets with 5 overs to spare &ndash; an unlikely looking scenario at drinks half way through the Waddesdon innings.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Thanks to Jamie for preparing another belter &ndash; the same strip that Cadmore had scored 229 on the previous week only to have that chased down by our Firsts in an uncannily similar game and approaching 1000 runs in 150 overs.&nbsp; A fine all round display and a victory that all could share the credit for as we stuck at it under difficult conditions in the field. A fine all round display from Monty and Nick were the pick and a final thanks to Andy who did the decent thing and turned up at the Swan to buy the beer!</p> <!--EndFragment--> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2013-07-21
1044,<p>Captain Richard OKelly took his team of youth## experience## inexperience and the unknown to Cublington on another beautiful sunny afternoon. After winning the toss he sent his troops in to bat. Nick Tegg ( experience ) and Max Dugdale ( youth ) opened for Ballinger and got off to a great start before Nick fell with the score on 62. In came Basty Richards ( youthful experience ) and he and Max added 74 before Max was&nbsp;stumped going for another big hit## Ballinger 136 for 2 off 25. Ben Dugdale up next ( youth ) out goes Basty with the score on 145. In comes David Cooke ( unknown experience ) and he and Ben add another 34 before David's bails are removed. To the crease Dom Brown ( youth ) another 12 runs added before Ben is out after making a solid 25. Matthew OKelly ( youth ) next in## Dom Brown next out## Ballinger 206 for 6 off 39 overs. Stuart Fray ( unknown experience )##runs himself out## in comes James to try and restore family pride only to be bowled first ball## a peach of a delivery from Cublingtons best bowler. In comes George Cooke ( youth ) with 2 balls ramaining and falling to the last ball of the innings. Ballinger&nbsp;finishing on 207 for 9 off their 40 overs. Still unused in the shade of the pavillion Richard OKelly ( experience hampered by injury ). Not a bad total but looked a little under par given the conditions.</p> <p>After an enjoyable tea and welcome shade Cublington took up the challenge in confident mood and pushed the score to 36 off 5 overs before losing their first wicket. Captain OKelly having to carefully manage his youthfull bowling options with the various age restrictions. Another quick wicket## again falling to Dom Brown with the score on 40 looked promising for Ballinger. A partnership of 76 for the next wicket took Cublington to 116 for off 19 overs## a great catch by the captain off Ben's bowling but the opposition now well ahead of the required rate. Captain OKelly continued to juggle his attack but some big hitting and dropped catches kept the opposition in control. Wickets continued to fall but Cublington&nbsp;managed to chase&nbsp;down the required runs with 4 overs remaining.</p> <p>An enjoyable game## played in a good spirit on a lovely day. A good team effort highlighted by a great batting performance from Max and excellent bowling from George.</p>,,2013-07-21

1010,<p>The heatwave relented for Ballinger's visit to the attractive National Trust surroudings at Waddesdon## and having (unusually) won the toss## Ian Davies## back with us after his hols## decided to take first knock. With current form batsmen Matt Riley and Richard O'Kelly both in the side again## this seemed a sensible choice. A slow steady start was to be expected## but the scoring rate accelerated encouragingly## as they took the total to 57 before Matt went## caught in the 18th over. However## Richard was scoring freely and the score had reached 85 when## soon after he tweaked a hamstring responding to a call for a very sharp single## he too holed out## for a well struck 56. By this time the Waddesdon bowlers were starting to cause problems## notably Atteek who persuaded umpire Miles Dugdale## nobly officiating at both ends (as well as ensuring both scorers were doing their jobs properly) to give two LBW's## including skipper Davies first ball. Ouch## its a long way to come from South London for that! As usual## Carlton could be relied on to shepherd&nbsp;the wobbly middle-order## as&nbsp;85 for 2 became 124 for 6## and&nbsp;when he was out for a fine 40## the total was 140&nbsp;for 7##and only two overs left&nbsp;.&nbsp; Two towering 6's from the new Nick Adams bat then&nbsp;put a much better look to the board as the innings closed on 162 for 7.</p> <p>In contrast to the Ballinger start## Waddesdon were immediately in trouble## with both Nick and Carlton gaining LBW's. That was as good as it got## though## and Waddesdon were well up with the required run-rate by the time the third wicket fell on 66## with the departure of the hard-hitting Bird (LBW## again) for 45## the first of Andy Thompson's three victims. The middle-order## like Ballinger's## lost their way## and at 96 for 6 in the 24th over## a victory looked likely. Alas## Waddesdon's number seven## Zagram## who had previously conceded 26 runs off his three overs## decided to get his own back. He launched a blistering assault on the bowling## taking 20 off Carlton's last over (plus two byes!)## and completely swung the game in Waddesdon's favour. At 160 for 6## and only&nbsp;3 required for victory## Zagram drove a ball boundary-wards## and sauntered down the pitch## convinced that it would be a four&nbsp; In some frenzied confusion## in the end it was only one run. He therefore deprived himself of a 50## as he was bowled by Nick immediately afterwards for 49## and with a run out at the other end## suddenly there was a gleam of hope for Ballinger. However## it was too late## and Waddesdon eased home by two wickets## and five overs to spare. Chief wicket-taker was Andy Thompson## with 3 for 50## but&nbsp;a word of praise for Ian Davies## who bowled a very tidy spell of 9 overs## taking 1 for 31## thereby justifying his lengthy journey!</p> <p>A pleasant match## well contested## against sociable opponents. As usual## Ballinger's youngsters## this time&nbsp;the Dugdales## Dom Brown## and Matt O'Kelly all acquitted themselves well in the field. Where would we be without them?</p>,,2013-07-22

1045,<p>Belsize Village Cricket Club## the Currymen## were Sundays visitors to the mildly moist acres of Ballinger. Captain Stuart McGowan won the toss and against Ballinger tradition chose to field on a wicket that he thought could be unpredictable after the heavy rain of the previous evening. How right he was.&nbsp;Some decent&nbsp;bowling and unpredictable bounce made it difficult for VCC who struggled all through their innings. Wickets fell constantly with the Currymen finding the Ballinger attack and wicket too hot for their liking. Afternoon tea was looking more likely to be a late lunch as they limped to 101 all out off 29 overs with the clock not yet reaching 3.45pm.</p> <p>Ballinger in to bat until tea at 4.30pm## Max obviously deciding to try and finish the game before and launching the first ball to cover for a well taken catch. Fally## apparently playing to the same script## hit the next ball## with a similar shot##&nbsp;to the same fielder## 0 for 2 off 2 balls .&nbsp;Two Bombay Ducks.&nbsp;Steve Carter in next and the Currymen with renewed hope. Good bowling from VCC## also helped by some unpredicatble bounce continued to challenge Steve and Basty with Steve falling on 17 trying to hit across a straight one. In came Monty to try and see Ballinger through until tea without any further mishap only to be caught 2 balls later with VCC crowding the bat. 17 for 4 off 7 overs## now things were getting very hot for Ballinger. Ben to the middle and he and Basty managed to avoid further bloodshed before tea.</p> <p>After a welcome break and excellent tea provided by Veronica Richards## Ben and Basty took up the challenge with the viisitors in confident mood and sensing an unexpected upset. Ben and Basty had other ideas and batted the next 20 overs sensibly## adding 76 before Ben was bowled after making an excellent 40. With the score now 93 for 5 in came Alex with Ballinger only needing 9 to win and the clock not yet at 6.15pm. He and Basty saw the team home in the 30th over but not without a scare or two along the way. Basty finishing on 40 not out.</p> <p>An enjoyable game## played in great spirit with the weather staying kind throughout. A disapponted VCC off to the Swan to drown their sorrows## followed by a curry at the New Akash before their journey back to North London.</p>,,2013-07-29
1011,<p>It was supposed to rain. From 6am Saturday## said the Met Office## and it would be torrential. With this apocalyptic forecast## the captains went out to toss up## under a hot sunny sky## with no sign of what might be beyond the horizon. Latest indications## via numerous smart phones now suggested rain at 4 - or possibly 6pm. So## what to do? Ian Davies## having won the toss## and with a vastly changed side at his disposal## including 6 juniors## decided to be brave## and batted first## A lot would depend on Richard O'Kelly maintaining his run of form## and Andy Thompson who opened with him. It was a shock then## when the first to go with the total only 14 was Richard## caught behind off a fine edge. Next in was Rob McIntyre## making only his second appearance for the Firsts. Not that one would have guessed## by the way he batted## with calm assurance. Andy## meanwhile after a quiet start was opening up with a string of boundaries## until he too got a thin edge## but this time undetected by the umpire## who sent him on his way LBW. In came Will Smith##holder of the club record highest score##for his first appearance of the season. He and Rob soon had the scoreboard speeding along## and reached 105 by the 21st over when Rob perished to one of those catches which are plucked from the sky when a boundary looks certain## for an excellent 32. Ian Davies## desperately in need of runs## now came to the crease. He was batting increasingly confidently## and with Will playing some delightful shots## it seemed that a 200+ total was in prospect## when Ian called Will for a risky single## onlyto seeWill run out by a direct hit. He had made 34## and was making batting look easy. Spinner Hafiz then accounted for Monty and Fally in the same over## while Ian struggled successfully to keep the score moving. Dom Brown and newcomer Theo Reynolds did well to add a few## and then Ian ##hitting outas he had to## was caught for a valliant 23## and the innings closed soon after## 168 all out in the 38th over.</p> <p>Tea was taken with the skies starting to darken. The immediate question was whether Bradenham would manage to get 20 overs batting. Therafter##if the rain came## the result would be determined by run rate. It was inevitable therefore that they would seek to set a fast scoring rate from the off. There was nothing wrong with the rate## but their wickets soon started falling. Ian started things## trying out his spin as opener## and struck in the 4th over## courtesy of a fine stumping by Richard. Dom came on to replace him and although having difficulty finding his direction## took two quick wickets## one another fine piece of work by Richard who took a tumbling catch. With Bradenham 70 for 5 in the 14th over## Ballinger now had victory in sight-they thought - providing the rain kept away. But the next wicket did not go down until 100 was on the board## and then a seventh wicket stand of 55 due mostly to some big hitting by Sherazee (43) finally turned the game Bradenham's way. A couple more wickets fell## but with 42 overs at their disposal the batsmen could take it easy## and as it was they only needed 30 overs to pass the Ballinger score. All the Ballinger bowlers acquitted themselves well## with Dom taking 4 for 41 and Alex Howe 2 for 32. The fielding was excellent. All that was wrong was that Ballinger needed another 40 runs! And conceding 14 wides perhaps didn't help.</p> <p>The rain did arrive. Around 7pm. And yes## it was torrential!</p>,,2013-07-29
1027,<p>We're doomed Mr. Mainwairing## we're doomed was the cry coming form all the phone holding meteroligists. With this thought in mind the skipper went to the wicket with the Bradenham captain certain in his course of actions. Unfortuantely he lost the toss again.</p> <p>The hosts skipper had no doubt about his plan either and the Waggoners were inserted with the intention of the home team to bowl us out quickly and then knock off the runs before armaggedon arrived.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Bastie and Tom opened up for the visitors and although it was slow progress they didnt look in any trouble from the bowlers but the pitch was interesting. After about 30 mins without mishap and the batting order settled our No5 had to depart to collect the missing member of the team. Not sure would have happened if we'd been fielding.</p> <p>No sooner had he left the ground than Bastie - having looked very comfortable## got a leading edge. Matt O'Kelly was removed by a brilliant catch at slip## Steve Conway was run out by a rediculous peice of fielding## Tom finally fell to another catch and the skipper was changing the batting order so frequently that everyone was padded up but not sure when they were going in## and we're still two players short.</p> <p>The skipper has to enter the fray at 6 which is oxygen country for him. Being bowled a straight one wasn't fair and certainly wasn'twhat he needed.&nbsp;Max Dugdale had now arrived was changed and straight into action&nbsp;and we though he and brother Ben might dig us out of the trench we were now in. Sadly Ben also missed a straight one## Freddie Thompson now strides to the crease and at 49 - 6 Bradenham's skippers plan was obviously working as they'd only bowled 24 overs.Freddie and Max set about doing a bit of a repair job before Max fell trying to thump a scouser back to Liverpool. Freddie kept plugging away and then Paul Branigan missed a straight one - anyone notice a theme here - and in comes Sam Phillips. He and Freddie then hustled the score along to 100 before Sam was caught and finally Fin Clark and Freddie bated out the last couple of overs taking us to 114</p> <p>A respectable score considering where we were.</p> <p>The skipper had a master plan. He was going to open with Freddie and Ben with the old ball. Frankly for the first 9 overs the Braddenham batters didnt have a clue how to play either Freddie's legspin or Ben's Off-spin. Ben took a wicket in his first over and suddenly the Wagoners were on their toes.</p> <p>Unfortunatelyly with such a small total the required run rate of 2.8 was just too easy to maintain. Regardless of the efforts of the Ballinger bowlers## including a fine spell from Sam Phillips## and some outstanding catching by Bastie and Sam it was all too easy for the home side and they cruised home with 16 overs to spare.</p> <p>We missed one very difficult chance which was the Braddenham opener who scored an unbeaten 59. If that had been taken who knows as we pretty confident they didnt have much left.</p> <p>The rain## well it arrived an hour later whilst we're sat in the pub with the 1s nursing our collective wounds and did it rain - too late</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2013-08-03
1012,<p>A pleasant sunny afternoon greeted Ballinger at the equally pleasant Potten End ground## and skipper for the day Ian Maciver started proceedings by losing the toss##&nbsp;with the home side taking first knock. They were soon in trouble## with both Nick Adams and Andy Thompson quick to strike## and wickets fell regularly## with only Gurney defying the bowlers and keeping his side in the game. The total had reached 84 for 5 in the 25th over when a heavy and protracted shower sent the players off## and an early tea was taken## with loss of 4 overs from each team's 40 overs. Potten End's run rate was already quite good## thanks to their excellent judgement of quick singles## and following the break they tried to raise the tempo still more. The result was the rapid loss of wickets## including the prize one of Gurney (50)## so that they had slumped to 99 for 9 before a last wicket stand of 26## spearheaded by the aggressive Davis (26 not out)&nbsp;took them to 125 before the final wicket went down in the 35th over. Ballinger had looked very impressive in the field## with Jono Lacey and Hamish Sim saving plenty of runs## and Max Dugdale giving a sharp display behind the stumps. Andy ( 4 for 19) just pipped Nick&nbsp;(4 for 21) in the bowling honours department.</p> <p>Ever keen to experiment## Ian sent the Thompsons## father and son## out to open the Ballinger reply.Neither found the going easy##against fast and short-pitched bowling## and just as they seemed to be weathering the storm## Andy was adjudged run out## having failed to ground his bat in completing a single. He was not convinced of the justice of this decision## but that's cricket## Andy! DRS where art thou? In came Rollo## desperately searching for some runs this season## only to depart caught at the wicket 3rd ball. 13 for 2 and 9 overs gone - not good. The arrival of Rob McIntyre immediately steadied the ship## not for the first time## and he was going well when another run out incident befell the team. He had## immediately prior to this## aggravated a knee injury## and when faced with Monty three quarters of the way down the pitch for a non-existent run## gamely sacrificed his own wicket. Next in was Jono Lacey## who wasted little time in boosting the slow scoring rate## and with Monty batting in Riley-esque mode at the other end## the total had reached 65 when Jono departed for a well-struck 18. Monty## by now joined by Jamie Kellock## was starting to hit the ball really well## and the score had reached 108 when he fell undeservedly one short of his 50. Quick runs still being a neccessity## next in was go-to hitter Nick## and this time he obliged with a rapid 12## leaving Max to see Ballinger home&nbsp;with a couple of lusty blows## and three overs to spare.</p> <p>Having lost to Potten End earlier in the season## this was welcome revenge## and the points gained lifted us to the top half of the league table## an unaccustomed pleasure! We should not get carried away## as the&nbsp;remaining fixtures are difficult## particularly the final two. It was good to see Dick Beard in the white coat ##back from his Florida holiday - well most of us thought so!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2013-08-05
1046,<p>Amersham on the Hill was the venue for this 40 over encounter. Amersham won the toss and chose to bat on what looked a good wicket. Their 1st X1 openers## looking to find some form in the Sundays## put the Ballinger attack under immediate pressure with some great stroke play and powerful hitting. On a small ground with a fast outfield the score escalated## 85 off 10 and the bowlers not quite knowing what to do. 129 off 14 before the 1st wicket## Jake tempting the bat down the wicket and Fally swiftly removing the bails. Jake claimed his second wicket with the score on 156## a good catch taken by David Cooke. Unfortunately the opener was still in and going strong## closing in on his ton. On 197 off 22 overs he retired unbeaten on 102. The runs continued to flow with the occasional pause with the fall of a wicket## Amersham getting to 322 with 3 balls remaining but deciding that was enough carnage for the day&nbsp;and the possibility they would run out of balls. But would it be enough!!!!!</p> <p>After an excellent tea and much soul searching## a beleaguered Ballinger took to the middle in pursuit of the impossible. Basty and Monty opened only to find their 1st X1 bowlers were also looking to regain some form. Basty was the first to go with the score on 10## Jake to the middle. Monty next to go with the score on 26. Sam Cooke## alias George for scorecard purposes## next up. The pair then proceed to put on 139 off 20 overs## Jake the main run scorer but Sam playing his part before being bowled after making an excellent 37. Jake closing in on his maiden century is joined by Toby Lyons who unfortunately gets the best delivery of the day and gloves his first ball to the keeper. Fally next to join Jake with Ballinger still trying to chase down the impossible. Jake passes the magic 100 before exhaustion takes its toll and he's bowled off his pads from not a great delivery. Fally is joined by Ben with the pair looking to up the rate with the score on 175 for 6 off 28. Ben out## well caught going for a cover drive. In comes David Cooke with Fally on the charge. David next to go with the score on 203 off 31 overs. Tom Petrie to the middle and the boys still giving it a go. Fally finally falling after making a swift 32 off 23 deliveries. Alex Howe joins the fray and makes an even quicker 32 off 17 deliveries before skying one. Ballinger all out for 275 in the final over.</p> <p>A great game## played in good spirit. A strong Amersham side always in control but a spirited Ballinger gave it their best.</p>,,2013-08-05
1028,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">At 1.15pm when the skipper went out to toss up the visitors only had 6 men and how tempting it was to bat first. The arrival of a car which disgorged 4 players was enough to change his mind when he actually won the toss for a change.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">When drinks were taken Cadmore were on just 80 off 20 overs which## on another excellent pitch and very fast outfield## meant the skipper was feeling rather the pleased with himself. Tom Petrie in particular and Sam Peters as well had kept a reasonable line although a few too many wides were being conceded. Tom had removed one opener with the help of a smart catch by &lsquo;keeper Freddie Thompson and then Ben Dugdale## who&rsquo;d replaced Tom removed danger man Dutton.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Unfortunately drinks meant a change of &lsquo;keeper and a change of approach by Cadmore. Carnage ensued with the visitors accelerating form 80 to 262 in just 20 overs. No bowler was unscathed but Freddie was probably the unluckiest with several deliveries just missing the stumps. He did get his reward with 4 wickets but the damage had been done. 43 extras was not a pretty sight in the score book</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A slightly disgruntled team ambled off for tea.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A torn hamstring to &lsquo;new&rsquo; boy Richard Devas meant a rethink in the batting order but &nbsp;Peter Petrie was happy to step up to the plate and he and Bastie set off in pursuit of the impossible target. Soon both were playing some delightful shots with Bastie in particular reeling off a selection of wonderful drives. The moans from the sidelines were now becoming cheers of encouragement as the pair kept the run rate within sight. Peter fell when the score was 70 so Bastie was joined by the newly promoted Ben who announced his arrival with a well struck 4. These two continued to almost keep up with the run rate and batting points were being accrued with alacrity. Bastie was finally out for an excellent 56 but Ben was now into his stride. Steve Conway made a brief visit to the crease before complaining of a pulled hamstring as well. This meant the arrival of a runner in the shape of Sam Peters. To say the speed of the running between the wickets increased is like saying Usain Bolt is quick. Ben and Sam were scampering singles## turning 1s into 2s and even 2s into 3s. Great to watch and soon had the Cadmore fielders in disarray.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Steve decided## with the encouragement of the umpire## to leave the field and let Ian McCloughlin have a go. He did but needed more chalk. Paul Branigan now joined Ben who had already smashed his way past 50. Paul played some delightful late cuts and guides helping Ben add another 20 before he guided one onto his stumps. Ben was finally caught for a really good 77 justifying his skipper&rsquo;s confidence in him.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The final bonus point was passed as the game came to its inevitable conclusion. 220 would have been a sensible score to chase but it was great to see the batters doing their best to chase down the target.17 points was a decent reward for everyone&rsquo;s efforts.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A lovely day## decent opposition and a great tea.

1013,<p>For once Ballinger fielded an almost unchanged side## against visitors bottom of the table Ley Hill## with Ian Davies back## and for once winning the toss.&nbsp;Taking the field&nbsp;first## Ballinger were immediately gifted two wickets## with messrs Lown and Clarke## who had both taken 60's off us in June## back in the hutch thanks to ill-advised run selection and excellent Ballinger fielding## and the total only 10. Dreams of further quick wickets were soon shattered by the arrival of S Daluwatte## who after having been missed in the slips before he had scored then gave a lovely exhibition of straight driving and was looking to rapidly put Ley Hill out of sight when to his## and everyone's## surprise he was bowled by the persevering Andy Thompson. Cue shrieks of joy## especially from our Captain## who was having a good day## taking two smart slip catches during the innings. Ley Hill continued to bat well## but though the&nbsp; total mounted&nbsp;quickly## wickets continued to fall## and at 99 for 6 in the 21st over## things were looking promising. However## a stand between Kemp and Cartledge had yielded 42 before Max Dugdale## standing up to Nick Adams## took a smart catch## to cap a generally excellent&nbsp;display behind the stumps. Nick promptly took another wicket with his very next ball## but&nbsp; a last wicket partnership added a tantalising further 22 runs## before Ian Maciver finished matters off##&nbsp;and the innings closed on 170## made in only 34 overs.</p> <p>Ballinger had to endure ten minutes batting before tea could be taken. Ley Hill opened with Duluwatte bowling off spin## with silly-mid on and silly-mid off both under the batsmen's noses. The ploy paid handsome dividends## with Monty and Rollo both clean bowled## so that Ballinger left the field on 4 for 2 after three overs. After an excellent Webster tea## Ballinger's woes rapidly deepened## with Jono also bowled by Daluwatte. 4 for 3## and the prospect of a massive batting disaster looked a possibility. But not to Andy## batting with his customary calm## and now joined by Ian Davies## determined to put a poor season behind him. Together they defended doggedly## and Ley Hill captain Ottaway then made a bowling change that perhaps changed the outcome of the match## by resting&nbsp;Daluwatte##&nbsp;who had&nbsp;taken 3 for 5 in 6 overs. Andy and Ian were able to move up several gears## and had added an invaluable 71 for the fourth wicket## when Andy fell LBW for 33. Ian perished shortly afterwards## then Max also attracted the umpire's disapproving finger## and at 92 for 7 Ballinger looked doomed## especially as the wicket was by now starting to misbehave - to the chagrin of Jamie who was undone by a sharply lifting delivery. &nbsp;There followed a quite remarkable partnership between Hamish Sim and Ian Maciver. Hamish batted with total confidence## scoring all round the wicket with some delightful shots## whilst at the other end Ian mainly took on the role of defying the wiles of Daluwatte## in his second spell##&nbsp;determined not to be undone by a fellow spinner!. Thanks to Ley Hill having used only 34 overs in their innings## Ballinger now had the luxury of 46 overs to bat## so time was on their side. Daluwatte conceded only two more runs off his remaining four overs## but crucially he could not get a wicket. Gradually the prospect of defeat started to recede## and the unbelievable prospect of a win replaced it. Hamish was by now in comlete control of the bowling## and Ian was taking toll of any loose deliveries. Also massively aiding Ballinger's quest was Mr Extras## with the amazing total of 46 (the match's top scorer!)## including 24 byes and 15 no-balls. With three overs to spare Ballinger cruised home## with Hamish undefeated on 40## and Ian likewise on 20## having put on an unbroken 79 for the eigth wicket.</p> <p>A thoroughly excellent game of cricket## with the result in doubt almost to the end## and played by both sides in good spirit.</p>,,2013-08-11
1047,<p>The Lee won the toss and chose to bat on yet another good wicket and sunny day. A wise choice as their openers put on 80 off 15 overs before losing their first wicket## LBW to Andy Thompson. In came Morgan## their star turn## who survived an early scare## a very close LBW shout## again from Andy Thompson who looked questioningly at the umpires lack of finger movement. As&nbsp;Morgan then went on to make 92 off 60 balls the umpire shall remain annonymous. The score escalated to 136&nbsp;for 3 off 26 overs with The Lee seemingly in control. Captain Thompson throws the ball to McGowan## 3 dot balls## a sharp stumping from Max## caught and bowled## hat trick ball with the fielders&nbsp;crowding the new batsmen## bowled## a hat trick maiden##&nbsp;136 for 6 off 27 overs. Unfortunately&nbsp;## Morgan is still at the crease and scoring freely## the unamed umpire still questioning his earlier decision. He finally falls to a good catch from the captain off the bowling of Alex Howe with the score on 203. The Lee add another 15 runs for the loss of 1 wicket in the remaining overs before tea## taking them to 218 for 8 off 39 overs.</p> <p>After an excellent tea provided by Barbara Dugdale the captain maintained the Dugdale theme and put Max and Ben in to open the innings. Max survived a couple of dodgy moments as the pair put on 39 before Ben caught a top edge and was out. Max was next to fall with the score on 56 off 10 overs. Ballinger well up with the rate and The Lee in no hurry to get the ball back to the bowler. Ballinger took advantage of some generous bowling but gave wickets away## Jake 12 off 5## Ian 29 off 19## Fally 39 off 24## the score now 145 for 5 off 20 overs. Ballinger now requiring 74 off the remaining 15 overs. Given the conditions this should have been a stroll but the middle order couldn't get the ball away against some indifferent bowling. Wickets continued to fall and the introduction of Morgan and Line to the attack made things more difficult. The unamed umpire made another dubious decision giving Stuart McGowan LBW with the game still in the balance## 201 for 9. 18 runs required## 14 balls remaining the captain now joined by Will Arnold. Morgan to bowl to Thompson&nbsp;. .&nbsp;6 2 1&nbsp; . .&nbsp;9 off the over## 9 needed off the last over with the captain on strike. Boakes to bowl## 2 dot balls## pressure on## the captain launches the ball to deep mid wiicket## will it carry? Around runs&nbsp;Morgan## who else##&nbsp;to take a great catch on the boundary.&nbsp;All out for 210.</p> <p>An exciting game## Morgan definately man of the match with his 92 runs## 2 wickets and 3 catches. A brave effort by The Waggoners but a game they should have won.&nbsp;The unamed umpire still trying to come to terms with error of his ways.</p>,,2013-08-15
1048,<p>Captain Matt Riley took another youthful Sunday side to the sunny## rural retreat of Britwell Salome. Britwell won the toss and chose to bat. On a sloping wicket the Ballinger openers found it difficult to find line and length## highlighted by 13 wides in a final total of 21 extras. When the bowlers managed to find the strip the Britwell openers found it difficult to get the ball away but patiently stuck to their task and pushed the score to 53 off 16 overs before losing their first wicket. By this time captain Riley had turned to the spin of Ben Dugdale who got the breakthrough with a great delivery. Ben went on to bowl an excellent spell of 18 overs with control and variation keeping Britwell constantly under pressure. At the other end captain Riley rotated his bowling options and Ballinger rattled through their overs## whilst managing to keep the run rate below 4 an over. With the score on 185 for 6 off 49 overs and the clock on 4.30pm Britwell decided to take 1 more over. The batsmen on strike## looking like he'd been recruited from The New York Yankees## set about Ben's last over and clubbed a further 26 runs to take the score to 211 for 6 off 50 overs. Not something Ben deserved after his afternoon exploits.</p> <p>After a pleasant tea Riley and Smith took to the middle with the prospect of a maximum of 40 overs to chase down the required total. From the start they both set about the Britwell bowling with controlled batting. Will first to reach his 50 with Matt not far behind## the score reaching 124 off 23 overs before Matt mistimed and was caught. In came Basty who was deceived by the unusual action and delivery of Prior and was duly stumped. Ben was next in and he and Will pushed the score to 150 off 27 overs before Will was caught at long on going for another big. Disappointed but an excellent innings of 80 off 72 balls. Hamish joined Ben at the crease with Ballinger up with the rate## seemingly in control and batting to come. Then came the Ballinger middle order collapse. Ben next to go## again caught at long on## going for a big hit. A good knock of 30 off 29 balls. The score now 187 for 5 off 34 overs. Ballinger needing 25 off 6 overs with 5 wickets remaining. In the next 3 overs Ballinger lost 4 wickets## Steve Carter caught## Dom Brown run out without facing a ball## Alex Howe caught and Connor Underwood stumped first ball. Final pair at the crease James Fray and Toby Lyons with 17 needed off the final 16 balls. James played a few good shots but realising it would be too risky the pair saw out the remaining deliveries for a well earned draw.</p> <p>A great game## played in good spirit## an excellent advert for timed cricket.</p>,,2013-08-19
1030,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ballinger&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup> X1 visited Hawridge and Cholesbury on Saturday. Hawridge have been out of league cricket for a while and it&rsquo;s good to see them back in the MBL</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The skipper was a bit worried that at 1.15pm he still only had 6 players and when he went out to toss up he was slightly concerned as how## when he won the toss## he was going to field first. All irrelevant of course as he lost the toss and the Waggoners were asked to bat.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The skipper had also planned to open the batting but one look at the wicket encouraged him to think of the team and drop down the order to when they might need him most.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Therefore who to send in with Tom Petrie? Given the amount of ear bending he&rsquo;d received from him there was only one option and that was to send in Ben Dugdale.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Tale-ender to opener in two weeks## could he cope?</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Well Ben and Tom set of carefully against some decent bowling. They were always looking for singles and Ben&rsquo;s speed between the wickets was really helping push Tom along as well. At drinks (20 overs) The Waggoners were in the unusual position of not having lost a wicket with 68 on the board. Not enough but a good base. Ben then started to unfurl some excellent drives and cuts## pushed even harder to turn singles into twos and with the occasional &lsquo;slog&rsquo; dragged the score up to 132 before he was finally out for a really good 85. Dom Brown was now promoted up the order to keep the pace going and poor Tom was confronted with an even quicker version of Ben. These two added another 25 before Tom was out for a very well crafted maiden 50.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Dom was then helped by Steve Conway## David Cooke## Steve Carter and Paul Branigan to pull the visitors total up to a very respectable 192.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">An excellent tea as always## which the skipper was reluctant to leave behind## especially as it had just started raining. Unfortunately his team mates and the opposition were keen to play.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ballinger&rsquo;s juniors were now to witness a master class in batting from one of the host&rsquo;s long serving Sri Lankans. Rifai was a difficult enough bat to bowl against when he was in the Premier league and the skipper had Premier league bowlers at his command but now he had an attack whose average age was 15. As expected carnage followed.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Dom and Adeel opened up for Ballinger and they soon learnt that anything short## slightly wide## too full was just swatted away. Then when they did get the ball in the right place Reefer would play an elegant drive or a glance. After just 5 overs the score was on 50.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The skipper needed some control so turned to Ben and Will Arnold. Finally the flood stopped and he had chance to catch his breath. A smart bit of fielding by Tom ran out one opener but Drane was quickly into his stride and it was looking a bit ominous for the visitors. Then Will removed Drane thanks to a good catch by Tom## Dom was now back into the attack and we finally had the bit of luck we needed when Rifai missed a straight## shin high full toss and he was on his way. Low full tosses were now the order of the day as Dom now had Rupasinghe well caught low down by Steve Carter off one## and bowled Thomas with another.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">We&rsquo;d broken the back of the home side&rsquo;s batting but was it going to be too late. Hawridge had gone from 113-1 to 135 &ndash; 8 but Matt Rutt was still struggling on having been hit on the knee earlier in the game. Rutt and Reading added another 45## in the rain## before Adeel who had just returned to the action had Reading bowled with another low full toss. Then the important wicket of Rutt again bowled by Adeel.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">180-9 with 9 overs to go. 187 &ndash; 9 with 6 overs to go. &lsquo;Hang on a minute&rsquo; was the cry from the middle. They haven&rsquo;t just scored 7 runs. Thank goodness for Miles keeping track## not scoring of course## just keeping track of the score. 182-9 it should be.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Then its 185 -9 with 3 overs to go. This was going to be tight then Adeel bowled a very good straight ball to Hawridge&rsquo;s injured last man and their umpire had the difficult decision to give him out LBW.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">We&rsquo;d won. Well done team.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A miserable day for weather but a really enjoyable day&rsquo;s cricket. Thanks to H&amp;C for not arguing when the score was disputed and allowing common sense to prevail.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>",,2013-08-19
1015,<p>Match abandoned after one over## after Ian Davies## leading a seriously youthful side (plus Derek Richards making his 1st X! debut !) had asked a strong looking Holmer Green side to bat first## hardly surprisingly. Within 20 minutes of the teams leaving the field the pitch was awash.</p>,,2013-08-24
1016,"<p>On a warm cloudless afternoon at Downley## Ballinger could afford to relax in the knowledge that relegation was no longer an issue## and with a side restored to something approaching their strongest## they might be able to give a decent performance against their opponents## who would have been clear league winners had they not been docked points for fielding a non-registered player against the ultimate winners## Monks Risborough.</p> <p>Downley opted to bat first## and made a careful start. Hamish Sim struck to take the first wicket thanks to an excellent catch by Monty Thompson (who shone with his ground fielding## too)## but therafter the bowlers took an increasing hammering## and the second wicket was not to fall until the total had reached 101## with only 17 overs gone.&nbsp; By this time Adeel Iqbal was starting to bowl well## and he and Ian Maciver pegged back the scoring rate## to the extent that Downley found themselves 135 for 5 in the 25th over. Then Downley regained control## with opener Priestley narrowly missing a well-deserved ton when he was sixth out for 96## bowled by Adeel. Andy Thompson paid the price of being the ""death"" bowler## going for 18 in his final over## and Downley closed on 225 for 7.</p> <p>This should have been a perfectly reasonable target## but with Downley opening their bowling with two spinners## using the old ball##&nbsp;Ballinger then proceeded to give one of their more abject performances of the season## set in train by Matt Riley## well ahead in the batting averages##&nbsp;running himself out for a duck. Disaster then followed disaster. Richard O'Kelly looked to be well on top## when he was unexpectedly bowled## having made 25 out of a total of 30## and thereafter only Hamish(22) and Max Dugdale showed any tenacity## but with the run rate barely over two an over## any chance of making the requisite score had long since vanished## and the innings petered out limply in the 32nd over## all out for a paltry 89.&nbsp;</p> <p>As we had been thrashed in the earlier fixture by 10 wickets## it would have been a good way to end the season by showing that we were really not that bad. In this we failed## dismally. Never mind## the beers went down as well as usual## and hopefully those who went on to the curry night enjoyed themselves even more!</p>",,2013-09-02

the summer. Where has the season gone?</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Today we were hosting Widmer End, which due to the vagueries (interpret that how you will) of the MBL &lsquo;s fixture planners, was the only time we were to play them. How can you come to a satisfactory conclusion to a league when we played all of the teams above us twice and all bar one of the clubs below us once.</span>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">To the game. Skipper loses toss &ndash; again. Worst season ever, but, Widmer chose to bat. Not sure what the wicket is going to do so not too concerned about that and we have, for the second week running an excellent bowling attack.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Dom Brown opened up with Will Arnold at the other end. Dom is quick but a bit erratic and anything off line is keeping very low. In the right places its coming through with pace and bounce so Steve Conway behind the stumps is going to have an interesting afternoon.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Will is his normal accurate self but the Widmer openers have obviously been watching too much 20/20 and with no thought to the aesthetic side of batting swished and swatted at anything in their half of the pitch. This is incredibly annoying as they managed to put on 66 without playing a proper cricket shot.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Tom Petrie had now replaced Will and in his 3<sup>rd</sup> over finally got the break through the bowlers deserved. In his next over he also removed the other opener. This should have meant a more sensible approach to batting but none of it, each new batsman continued in the same vein. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to set a field when you don&rsquo;t know where the ball is going to be hit.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">James Fray now bowled a spell of quick aggressive bowling and with Ben Dugdale now on at the other end the Balinger bowlers were slowly working there way through the visitors line up. A good ball from Ian McCloughlin, some well flighted off spin from Ben another tight spell from Will and suddenly the visitors were all out.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">The bowlers were supported by some good catches by Steve, James and Nigel plus excellent ground fielding all round including a brilliant run out by Ben.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">A total of 151 looked a bit below par</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">After another excellent tea thanks to Fiona Conway the skipper had to sort out the batting order.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Following their success last time out he decided to send out Ben and Tom again. The bowling didn&rsquo;t look anything special and neither looked in any trouble so the skipper went back to the tea. At which point Tom had that most frustrating bit of bad luck when the ball roled back onto his stumps. David Cooke then joined Ben and these two tickled along for a few overs before David tried successfully to just reach a wide and dolly a catch, Ian McCloughlin then helped Ben add just over 20 before giving some more catching practice. Steve came and went but in the meantime a huge moment of controversy. Did Ben snick a catch behind or not? The opposition thought so and were determined to make the rest of his stay as unpleasant as possible.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Paul Branigan was now at the crease and in a typically unselfish approach proceeded to blunt his way&nbsp; to 2 off 27 balls, whilst Ben was taking full advantage of his good fortune. At 109 for 4 the skipper was quietly confident and had set off on another stroll round the ground. Unfortunately by the time he had reached the safety of the pavilion again the Waggoners &nbsp;batting line up was in disarray. In 6 overs we lost 5 wickets for 14 runs.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">This meant the side&rsquo;s two senior pros ( or invalids) had to don the pads and try to rescue the game. Fortunately there were plenty of overs left and it didn&rsquo;t take long for Peter Petrie to find his range and the visitors were also running out of bowlers. This enabled the skipper and Peter to guide The Waggoners home with Peter finishing with a flourish hitting a 6 to win the game.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Despite the fuss over Ben it was an enjoyable game and it was good to see how well Ballinger held up in the field when the ball was flying all round the place. A few weeks ago the bowlers would have lost control and we could have easily been chasing 200+</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">It was also great to play against a team that come to the pub so all the on field problems can be solved over a pint.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">A really enjoyable season thanks in no short measure to the weather.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US""><em><strong>A few thank yous:</strong></em></span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">To Paul for somehow getting out a team each week. I&rsquo;m not sure how many realise the difficulty of getting 33 players on the pitch each week but it&rsquo;s almost an artform.</span></p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">To Miles for umpiring.

1050,<p>Another sunny Sunday afternoon## Ballinger winning the toss and choosing to bat on what looked yet another great wicket. Matt Riley and Stuart&nbsp;Clark&nbsp;enjoying the conditions and some generous bowling and taking the score quickly to 13 before Matt## continuing his excellent weekend form## forgets to hit a straight one. O'Kelly junior joins Stuart at the crease and so began the S. Clark batting masterclass. The pair put on 101 in the next 20 overs## Stuart the main contributor but a solid 22 from Matthew. Steve Carter next in to join the maestro and a further 36 runs added before Steve hears the rattle of his stumps## Ballinger 150 for 3 off 28 overs. Max Dugdale next in and eager for runs## Stuart now scoring freely. the pair proceed to put on 108 runs in 11 overs## Max riding his luck a few times but playing some big shots highlighted by a flat 6 back over the bowlers head and clearing the hedge. Captain Thompson then deciding to end the carnage and generously declaring the innings with Ballinger on 258 for 3 off 39 overs## Max not out 60 off 35 balls and Stuart 146 off 118 balls in what was a flawless display. Perhaps the captain should have batted a few more overs????</p> <p>A superb innings was complemented with an equally superb tea provided by Azra Iqbal. Wendover took to the middle with a big target to chase but time and overs in their favour. Captain Thompson opted for spin from both ends and was rewarded with 2 early wickets from the bowling of Freddie Thompson. The visitors 12 for 2 off 2 overs. Robinson## the opening bat was looking dangerous and hitting some big shots and a partnership of 53 off the next 6 overs sent alarm bells ringing. He launched an enormous blow off Freddie out towards the deep mid wicket boundary## around ran Ben Dugdale## brilliantly judging the flight of the ball and taking a stunning catch## Robinson looking on in disbelief## a game changer. Ballinger now back in control and some good bowling from Fin Clark and Sam Peters kept the pressure on. Wickets continued to fall&nbsp;with Wendover&nbsp;on 125 for 6 off 24 overs as the clock&nbsp;struck 6pm. 133 runs required## 4 wickets to take off the remaining 20 overs. Their&nbsp;captain Seabrook now at the crease and deciding a draw&nbsp;was the only option. A solid partnership developed putting on 43 runs for the eigth wicket## taking Wendover to 173 with&nbsp;9 overs remaining. Seabrook now trying to batten down the hatches and keep the strike whenever possible. The ninth wicket falls## bowled Ben Dugdale## 7 overs left. Overs go by## 195 for 9## 2 overs left## the captain calls on the man he can trust the most to finish the job## himself!!! Dot ball## dot ball## wicket## brilliant captaincy## the result never in doubt## the early declaration inspired.</p> <p>An exciting game## played in the true spirit of timed cricket.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2013-09-02
1204,<p>Our first early match of the season.</p> <p>High Wycombe opened the batting and scored steadily to get their 109 runs. Not a great target## but fading light towards the end of our innings meant we were chasing an achievable 15 runs in the last two overs. &nbsp;In the end we lost by just 10 runs.</p> <p>Notable performances by Henry King (batting)## &nbsp;Harri Doyle (batting and bowling) and James Arnold## Miles Devereux and Simon Carlin (all bowling).&nbsp;</p> <p>A good effort all round## considering we have not had a practice session yet!</p>,,2014-04-28
1202,<p>Away to Holmer Green for the opening League match## with seemingly half of the members away or otherwise occupied## did not bode well for&nbsp;Ballinger. Holmer Green won the toss## and predictably decided to bowl first## on a damp wicket. Against an accurate attack## Ballinger were soon in trouble## losing the vital wicket of Richard O'Kelly in only the fourth over. Andy Thompson&nbsp;was soon displaying his customary doggedness## and with Rollo McIntyre they had ground their way to 34 in the 17th over## before Rollo&nbsp;fell to a good catch. This opened the floodgates## and wickets crashed rapidly to the pacy Weerakoon and spinner Gumb## and when Thompson went for a splendid## defiant 25 after nearly two hours at the crease## the total was only 53 for 7. That immediately became 53 for 8## and the end seemed nigh. However## some lusty blows from newcomer Andy Rowe helped the scoreboard reach a pathetic final tally of 69 all out## in 35 overs.</p> <p>There was time for four overs before tea## and with Nick Adams' first over going for 10## the prospect of a very early end to the match was in sight. However## Nick quickly found his rhythm## and bowled Watt in his second over## and with Will Reid bowling well at the other end## tea was taken with HG on 13 for 1. Weerakoon rapidly showed that he was no mean batsman as well as a bowler## and looked to be taking the game well out of reach## as the total climbed to 45 with only 3 wickets down. But Nick## who had already claimed the prolific Kevin King LBW## then sent back Weerakoon the same way. The innings then fell apart in much the same way as Ballinger's had done## with Andy Thompson producing a mean spell of bowling## taking 3 for 10## complementing his fine batting earlier. At the other end Evan Webster went even better## destroying the HG innings with figures of 4 overs## 4 maidens## 3 wickets##&nbsp;0 runs.&nbsp;Ballinger's fielding was exceptional throughout## but the game still seemed lost when HG's skipper S Adams took them to within 5 runs from winning## then scooped a shot to square leg. The nearest fielder##Will Reid## pulled off an astonishing diving catch to hold the ball an inch from the turf## and suddenly Ballinger had won a remarkable victory. An unexpected## but highly enjoyable start to the season!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-05-04
1172,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Early season spring sunshine## beautiful Chiltern views and a blend of youth and experience taking the field &ndash; the best of Ballinger cricket.&nbsp; Ballinger won the toss and## as is customary on Sundays## elected to bat.&nbsp; Ballinger lost David Cooke (the senior partner in one of 3 father-son combos in the Ballinger team) early## but his opening partner## Richard O&rsquo;Kelly## thrived## with his usual mixture of care and aggression.&nbsp; He was well supported by Jamie Kellock and then 14-year-old Joe Turrell## playing his first adult match (and displaying great calmness and maturity in the process). Joe departed from a well-made 16## and Richard finally fell for 64## leaving Ballinger still relatively well-placed on 112 for 4.&nbsp; However## there then followed a small clatter of wickets## with Steve Conway probably about as plumb LBW as it is possible to get## and Freddie Thompson run out by a duly apologetic Paul Branigan.&nbsp; Rusty batting and rusty calling at the start of the season## I fear.&nbsp; Thankfully## Paul was joined by George Cooke (the third 14-year-old in the team)## and between them they put on useful runs## George finishing with a composed 24.&nbsp; As tea loomed (local rules compelling tea at 4.30 regardless of the state of the innings!) Ballinger closed with a respectable## but not overwhelming## 177 for 9 off 45 overs.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">We would have to bowl well## and field well## to win &ndash; always a challenge in these early-season matches! &nbsp;George Cooke and Matt O&rsquo;Kelly opened the bowling## both finding some good rhythm and largely sticking to a good line and length## removing one of the openers each. Then came the crucial partnership of the game## between the Pelicans numbers 3 and 4## Bailey and Patel## clearly their strongest two batsmen. &nbsp;Both punished bad balls## and both were served up a few. &nbsp;As the Pelicans 100 came up## with only 2 wickets down## the skipper turned to Freddie Thompson&rsquo;s legspin to try to conjure a wicket. &nbsp;In fact initially he delivered much-needed control## bowling an excellent line and length and keeping the Pelicans batsmen anchored in the crease for fear of stumping. That also allowed Andy Thompson to switch ends and coming down the hill bowl a rather better length with a bit more zip## resulting in the removal of the 2 main Pelican batters - and suddenly the game was opened up.&nbsp; The scoring rate slowed## Freddie claimed a wicket and Ballinger looked very much in the hunt. &nbsp;But tension remained and another partnership developed## bringing Pelicans to within 20 runs of victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;However## Freddie Thompson then bowled one of the last main threats behind his legs## and Joe Turrell claimed his first wicket for the Ballinger Sunday team## in a cameo performance with his slow left arm; and we were set for the tightest of finishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;Although the scoring rate slowed to a trickle## the overs were not really an issue &hellip;.. and the Pelicans had one strong batsmen left &hellip;. until he was removed by a thrilling piece of fielding from Matt O&rsquo;Kelly in the deep## combining with his father behind the stumps to complete an excellent run out. &nbsp;Ballinger felt that the momentum had swung their way and in a gripping last few overs (involving dropped catches## a crucial collision between batter and keeper## but luckily no diplomatic incident) George Cooke and Andy Thompson came back into the attack to claim one of the last 2 wickets each## completing an excellent victory by a mere 2 runs.&nbsp; As Dr Who would put it## definitely squeaky-bum time!&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The bowlers were supported by some surprisingly good fielding for so early in the season## with particular mention due to Ian McLoughlin## who seemed by the end of the afternoon to have done more fielding than the other 10 players put together## including an excellent catch out of the sun and some truly heroic athletic attempts.&nbsp; &nbsp;All in all## a great team effort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,2014-05-08
1205,<p>On a gloomy day &nbsp;with poor light Chesham wnet in to bat first. &nbsp;They scored a fair 103 with superb bowling and fielding by BWCC. A really good display in the field by the whole team with Ballinger taking six Chesham wickets## not done that before!!</p> <p>Then it was our turn to bat and the wheels fell off. &nbsp;We struggled to get 37 runs off the bat and where eventually all out for 49. &nbsp;Having said that all batsmen managed to stay in for several balls and none of the team lost there wickets through any fault of their own. We were simply facing ferocious bowling by some very good Chesham players. All the team stood up well to most of their spinners## but very accurate bowling by the faster bowlers was our undoing.</p> <p>An encouraging effort against a really strong team who were visibly worried after their innings! Unfortunately our batting did not shape up.</p>,,2014-05-10
1206,<p>Ballinger finally won a toss and went in to bat on a reasonable wicket with good light. Once again## however## our batting failed us with the first 5 wickets falling for less than 15 runs. Only Hugo and Matthew saved some face by putting on 23 runs between them (Matthew top scored with 15). Ballinger finished with 58 runs and a challenge ahead of them. Winchmore did have some good bowlers who managed to keep us on the back foot throughout and had us all out within 17 overs.</p> <p>Winchmore innings started slowly with our bowlers pinning them back with some excellent bowling and an early wicket. Then## despite continued good bowling## Winchmore started steadily putting on the runs. &nbsp;Our fielding and bowling were really excellent## with only two wides as the only extras recorded against us. &nbsp;The fielding and team support was noticably very good with every ball being chased down very hard and bowlers being encouraged by their team mates.</p> <p>Unfortunately we had not set them a high enough target and they reached this within 12 overs. &nbsp;Had they had a higher score to beat we would certainly have been able to win this game.</p>,,2014-05-10
1248,<p>We lost the toss and were put in to bat which on this sunny eveing suited our team as we knew the last few overs of the match could be challenging to bat in. Our openers Oliver and Archie were faced with some strong bowling from some very tall boys## they took us to 207## Thomas and Casper then followed and put on and then took off some runs## with no boundaries to be had we were still on 206 after 8 overs## Sebastian and Kuran moved us up to 226 after 12 and then Max C and Max FE brought us along to 244 afetr 16## our two great U9 players Raphi and on his debut for the U10A Edward led us to a respectable 270 from 20.</p> <p>Bledlow came in to bat and did not hold back## Oliver very smartly mixed up the bowling and wickets were taken by Oliver## Archie 3## Edward## Kuran## Max Fe and Casper## which shows the depth of our bowling attack.</p> <p>A great start to the season and despite playing agains some very large and powerful boys we delivered a well deserved result.</p> <p>Really Well done</p>,,2014-05-14

1155,<p>A warm sunny day greeted&nbsp; Premier Division new boys Bourne End at Ballinger. They lost the toss## and Ballinger skipper Ian Davies elected to take first knock. Against tight bowling and athletic fielding## openers Richard O'Kelly and Andy Thompson had taken the total confidently to 43 before Richard departed## the first of three LBW decisions to befall Ballinger. 43 for 1 had become 58 for 4 five overs later## as the middle order imploded in a not unfamiliar way## before skipper Davies joined Andy. Looking extremely vulnerable## in his first knock of the season## he managed to hang in there## as Andy's innings blossomed## and the pair had put on an invaluable 58 togther before Ian's luck ran out. Andy perished soon after## for a superlative 74## including two fine 6's.Thereafter## the innings subsided meekly and depressingly to 140 for 9## when the overs ran out.</p> <p>Nick Adams opened&nbsp;the Ballinger attack## and struck with his very first ball. And that was just about the only happy thing to report## as Bourne End's batsmen&nbsp;subjected the bowlers to a withering assault. Catches went down - 5 in all - and the ground fielding was markedly inferior to Bourne End's.&nbsp; In a mere 20 overs Bourne End reached their target (with a towering 6) and the BWCC team photo of a cheerful looking side taken as soon as the game was over was to celebrate the Club President (and scorer)'s 80th Birthday## certainly not their own performance!</p> <p>So serious was the situation deemed to be that plans for some net practice were decided on for the coming week - &nbsp;but that was after several pints. Will it happen???</p>,,2014-05-17
1138,<p>Another toss won and on a scorching hot day## a Scoop 6 ticket in the pocket## and only Arsenal in the cup final to watch at &nbsp;5pm## the decision to bat first was fairly straightforward. First problem was the absence of Mr Kerry - going to extreme lengths not to open the batting by driving backwards and forwards along the A41 until 1.30. Step forward the father/son Clark combo. Off to a solid start Stuart despatched the opening attack## seemingly at will. After Fin's departure he and Ben took the score past fifty. Wickets fell at regular intervals after that## but not before Stuart completed a good looking fifty. Steve Carter having his first knock of the year was joined by fellow seasonal debutant Nigel and they steadied the ship adding 45 at a decent strike rate. Nigel was replaced by the skipper and he and Steve stepped up the pace to a run a ball. With wickets in hand the Kamikaze Kid put paid to an obviously tiring Carter before he and 'gloves' Conway engineered (after one or two practice runs) another run out a few balls later. A couple more wickets fell in the final over but not before Ballinger reached 188 on a far from perfect wicket.</p> <p>Our opening bowlers did a fine job with Fin striking in the first over and he picked up two more to finish a decent spell. Andy Rowe finally got his reward after another longish opening spell and notched his first victims for Ballinger. Matt O'Kelly bagged himself two more for the season whilst MOM Carter## having already taken two catches volleyed the ball to Rob Mac who seeing the non striker stranded pinged it to Ben to complete a good bit of team cricket. Ben then duly wrapped up the match in the next over.</p> <p>A really enjoyable all round team performance with contributions from everyone with bat##ball and in the field.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-05-19

1209,<p>Ballinger won the toss and put Chalfont in to bat. The weather being kind and the pitch very good## this was a good decision.</p> <p>Ballinger bowling## once again## did the trick with some very impressive work from James Arnold (3 for 10 off 4 overs!!!). Although there were several wides## a few no balls and some fielding was not as sharp as previous games## we still held St Giles to 103## while taking a useful 7 wickets. 25 extras!!!</p> <p>And then it was our turn to bat## needing 104 to win. Understandably nervous## the opening batsmen held on## not scoring many runs but wearing down Chalfonts' better bowlers. This allowed the middle order to face a mix of bowling (still very neat and tight bowling with only 9 extras given away) and allowed them to settle and to start steadily chasing the runs. &nbsp;There was a tense point in the match with the required run rate nearing 8 per over with 6 overs to go. But with good solid batting performances by Harri Doyle (29) and Simon Carlin (31## retired) who were well supported by Miles Deveraux and Hugo Eaton-Hart (12 each) We reached the target in fading light with two ball to spare. &nbsp;Great team support for most of our innings was certainly a help## as was the encouragement by some parents!</p> <p>A good game with a very good result.

Our good bowling and tight fielding brought sparse reward and the openers played through and got to the total in almost 18 overs.</p> <p>Although a loss I was impressed by the magority of our batting and although we took no wickets we were tight in the field with some excellent bowling.

1157,<p>Ballinger's resplendent new scoreboard (courtesy of Kerry Joinery &amp; Artwork) made its debut## but the three shiny hooks for BWCC's total proved excessive##&nbsp;as for the second time this season&nbsp;their struggling batsmen failed to break 70.</p> <p>After a very wet week## the boundary had to be modified to exclude a swamp near the white hut## but in spite of its tempting proximity## none of Ballinger's batsmen took advantage. Instead they seemed primarily occupied with giving Haddenham catching practice. Two wickets went in only the second over as O'Kelly and Thompson (M) lasted 5 balls between them## gifting mistimed dollies to the grateful fielders. Sanity then prevailed## as Andy Thompson was joined by skipper Davies## and for an hour they defied an accurate attack## backed up by athletic fielding## whilst slowly but surely hoisting the total to 41 in the 17th over. Four overs later 41 for 2 had become 41 for 6## with Andy caught behind for a typical gritty 12## and Ian following the next over## playing no shot to a delivery that cut back to bowl him## for a valiant 19. Max Dugdale and Jamie Kellock went within the space of another nine balls## neither of them troubling the scorers. Dom Brown and Nick Adams contributed some lusty blows during their (very) brief innings## whilst Adeel Iqbal (at number 7)showed that it was perfectly possible to defend## batting for 41 balls before being last man out for 6## with only 30 overs used.&nbsp;Haddenham produced several remarkable catches ##to hasten Ballinger's demise## but## all told## it was a wretched effort.</p> <p>&nbsp;Ballinger took the field in the hope that as 69 had proved a winning total against Holmer Green## perhaps lightning might strike twice. This looked extremely unlikely as Haddenham sped to 18 in only 3 overs## and this had become 33 by the 6th over## when the fielding side were glad to head for the pavilion to enjoy a splendid tea## courtesy of Mr &amp; Mrs Kerry - definitely a Kerry day## but perhaps not much competition?&nbsp; Two wickets had in fact fallen during the pre-tea session## one a smart run-out## and the other the result of some impressive spin bowling by Monty Thompson## who had opened the bowling - an enterprising initiative. Father Andy now joined the fray## and was soon causing difficulties## taking 2 more wickets## as Haddenham started to wobble.&nbsp;Keeper O'Kelly then produced an excellent piece of stumping off Monty## and suddenly the curse of&nbsp;the forties&nbsp;seemed to be striking again as Haddenham slumped from 40 for 2 to 41 for 5. Will Reid and Evan Webster were given a miserly one over each in which to try pull off the improbable## but although both obliged with a wicket## Haddenham ended by cruising home with three wickets in hand## and only 17 overs gone.</p> <p>With the match done and dusted by 5.00pm## it was left to those with memories of long ago to recall when 5.00pm was the mid point of a cricket match.

1194,"<p class=""MsoNormal""></p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Some stories are best told briefly## and this is one. The Longwick outfield had clearly not been cut for a couple of weeks and would have fed a good-sized herd of Friesians for at least that long. It was## to be honest## a rather disappointing venue on the day## particularly since the square itself was very well cared for. Disappointing too was the Ballinger attack## nearly all of whom went for more than six an over in a 40 over limited overs game## allowing Longwick to compile a commanding total of 245 for 6## largely based on a score of 131 by their number three## Thornton - although many would have said that he could have been given out LBW at least 3 times before he had got into double figures. Ballinger just bowled too many bad balls## allowing him to slog the ball hard and high over the dense jungle that passed for an outfield for six (10 in all). We were really short of a couple of experienced bowlers on the day; although the youngsters pressed into service did their best and stuck at the task## showing great character.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">That left a very big task. Ballinger made a decent start## based around some good crisp hitting## comprising proper cricket shots## from Rob McIntyre (25) and eldest son Tom (55). Many which would have gone for 4 on a cut outfield gained just 1. Tom was later joined by younger brother James (24)## but when both were out in relatively quick succession## the Ballinger challenge faded## with a series of batsmen getting out heroically trying to push the scoring rate up to the spiralling levels required (including a trio of Bunces  Gary## Scott and James).

1208,<p>On a gloomy overcast day the umpires decided on an 18 over match.</p> <p>Marlow won the toss and went in to bat with their opening bat and 4th man in both retiring on 30 each we thought we may have our work cut out for us. As it turned out our bowling and fielding was## once again superb## on the whole. There was great team spirit which certainly helped the bowlers. Not sure if any batsmen were actually intimidated as they seemed to take the chirping in good humour. Marlow were held to 85 after their 18 overs. Valuable wickets taken by Bunce## Arnold and Petrie all of whom helped restrict the runs by some &nbsp;very good bowling.</p> <p>So## Ballinger in to bat with a reachable target of 86.

Rachel unlucky to be out a great catch and Hattie being bowled by a great ball. The tail really tried for all the extra runs with graet running and some sacrificing of wickets for runs.</p> <p>5 tight opening overs from Charlotte and Georgina meant Marlow were soon behind the rate being 22 for 1 off 5.

The openers ; Charlotte and Georgina came back on and only 3 runs were scored in the final 2 overs## so a well deserved victory.</p> <p>The good bowling was backed up by some excellent fielding.

Harry McMullan next up making his U17 debut## falling to a good delivery. Ballinger 33 for 4&nbsp;in the eigth over## the sun not shining so brightly. Matthew OKelly in next with Ballingerr in need of inspiration. He and Hamish putting on 50 runs in the next 6 overs before Hamish was caught on the boundary looking to push the score on. Ballinger now 83 for 5 and back in the game. Dom Brown joining Matthew and the pair putting on a further 26 runs before Dom runs himself out. 109 for 6 with 2overs left. Connor Underwood to the middle and he and Matthew adding 13 runs finishing the innings on 122 for 6. Was this going to be enough?</p> <p>Ley Hill took to the middle with their openers looking to push the score on and making 122 look well below par. Some agressive and accurate bowling from the Ballinger attack was rewarded when Sam Peters took the 1st wicket## Will Price trying to launch the ball into orbit## missing it completely and losing his middle stump##&nbsp;seemingly trying to outdo the Dugdale's. Hamish taking the next wicket with Ley Hill 21 for 2 off 5 overs. Jamie Woodley now joining Joe Batt at the crease and the pair adding 20 runs in the next 4 overs with a promising partnership developing. Ben Dugdale now bowling to Joe Batt who smashes the ball back down the wicket## Ben throwing himself at the ball## managing to deflect it onto the stumps with Jamie out of his ground. A fortunate but valuable wicket. Excellent bowling from Ballinger made it difficult for Ley Hill before James Fray took the importnad wicket of Joe Batt who tried to launch tha ball into orbit## missing it completely and losing his middle stump.

1141,<p>It didn't look promising at 10am when junior training was cancelled due to a wet outfield and there was a thunderstorm forecast. It didn't look promising at 2pm as## after winning the toss and inserting Ley Hill## they had raced to 50 without loss off the first eight overs. So a decision to take pace of the ball seemed the right one## although there was some surprise as the job fell to ex-quickie James McIntyre who hadn't bowled leg spin in a match at any level. Two wickets in his first over helped settle the nerves and with the help of Matt the brakes were gently applied to Ley Hill's runaway train. Searching around the team for another bowler the skipper alighted on one N.Kerry who was looking forward to another dreamy afternoon in the Ballinger sunshine. Lets make him sweat - although off three paces there wasn't much chance of that ! The barnacle-like opener was soon on his way back to the hutch bamboozled by the Kerry bag of tricks. The real story unfolded at the other end as young James completed a five timer for just 29 runs off his 10 overs with only 16 coming off the bat. Two tight spells from Matt which cost just 24 runs and a better second spell from Andy helped tighten the noose. Ballinger's third secret weapon ## McIntyre senior - looking to all intents and purposes like Jade Dernbach - sans tatoos - wrapped up the innings. The outfield cricket was excellent including a fine diving catch from 'pads' Conway.</p> <p>Our opening pair## average age 38## though one was nearly five times as old as the other ! Marcus Tingey## making his Senior bow## had kept very tidily and been deprived of a catch despite the edge being heard by some HS2 surveyors down the road ! He looked very comfortable before scooping one## bringing 'Jade' McIntyre to the crease. The two 'bowlers' showed another side to their games and took the score along to 70 before Nigel departed just 4 short of his fifty. Steve Carter continued the good work until he too fell with the score on 105. A mid order collapse ensued before the McIntyre combo steadied the ship. However Rob's departure led to another clatter of wickets so that when Andy joined the skipper as the last pair 26 runs were still needed off the last four overs. Recognising a chance at redemption for some ordinairy bowling Andy lashed the Ley Hill attack to all parts of the ground (well one really !) and Ballinger got home with 3 balls to spare.&nbsp;</p> <p>A hugely enjoyable game (and victory) with some notable performances amongst a fine team display.

1158,<p>A sunny## pleasant afternoon's cricket&nbsp;seemed&nbsp;a far from likely prospect in view of a forecast of thunder## lightning and heavy rain all morning. In the event## the rain was short-lived## and&nbsp;an efficient Ley Hill ground staff had covered the wicket## so that play could start on time## under blue skies.</p> <p>Trusting that their pitch would&nbsp;be a good one## Ley Hill took first knock## and openers Lown and Peterson were proceeding&nbsp;smoothly## until the latter was bowled by&nbsp;Nick Adams## who then accounted for Clarke the very next ball## undone by a full toss. This brought the dangerous Daluwatte to the crease## and he was soon scoring freely.&nbsp; Nick yorked&nbsp;Lown. to make it 43 for 3##finishing an excellent spell with 3 for 27## but Ballinger had to wait until the 20th over before Ian Davies pulled off a spectacular catch on the boundary to account for the hard-hitting Thompson## off Ian Maciver's spin. At 90 for 4## and only 22 overs gone## Ley Hill were now looking well placed for a commanding total## but in the space of the next six overs they lost their next 5 wickets for only 9 runs. We saw the unusual sight of three hat-trick chances as both Ian Maciver and Will Reid&nbsp;joined Nick in taking wickets with consecutive balls. Richard&nbsp;O'Kelly took a smart&nbsp; catch behind the stumps## and was cruelly denied a fine stumping effort. When the persevering Daluwatte fell LBW to Will for a well earned 36## the score was 105 for 9## and the end seemed nigh.&nbsp; Messrs Morris and Ottaway had other ideas though## and spent the next eight overs carefully## and occasionally aggressively## hoisting the total to 140 before Morris chanced his arm once too often## and Ian Davies gratefully grasped another skier. Ian Maciver ended with figures of 3 for 36## and special praise for Will Reid## with 3 for 19 off a hostile 7 overs.</p> <p>With five overs to bat before tea## Ballinger needed a safe start## but in only the second over Richard O'Kelly edged to the keeper## and left Matt Riley## making his first Saturday appearance this season## and Andy Thompson to survive until the break. This they did## but the scoreboard had only reached 25 with ten overs gone## when Andy edged## fatally##&nbsp;to the slips. Meanwhile Matt was batting confidently## and it was a surprise when he fell LBW for a well struck 23##&nbsp;giving Ottaway his third wicket. Max Dugdale continued his luckless season## also LBW## and it was 62 for 4. The in-form Ian Davies now joined Rollo McIntyre## and both of them batted splendidly## having to contend with a variety of accurate spin bowling## and gradually the total mounted## with every opportunity taken for quick singles. Rollo contributed his usual array of big hits## but his was a thoroughly responsible knock - the sight of him playing out maiden overs was a rare one!. With the total on 118## and victory now seeming a distinct possibility## Ian was bowled by the ever impressive Daluwatte for an invaluable 19## which brought Carlton in to join Rollo. Carlton smashed three consecutive balls from Ottaway for four## in an over which cost 14 runs## and Ballinger were virtually home and dry. Rollo finished unbeaten on 61## including 10 fours and two sixes - &nbsp;a wonderful return to the form of which we know he is capable.</p> <p>This was an all-round excellent performance by Ballinger## words which have not been aired for a while!</p>,,2014-06-08

This is our first real challenge and it become quite clear fro the off that they have been practicing and have new members.</span></p> <div style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"">Oliver and Archie open against some quality bowling and put on a very respectable 18## Raphi and Kuran take us up to 236 and Matthew and Louis on to 262 ## so far we have only lost 2 wickets [one of which was a borderline call by myself]## Sebastian and Max FE push us along to 274## so it looks like we could hit 300## but Thomas and Max only manage to get us to 288 as Max C decided to try new and innovative ways of being dismissed including a dilshan which was caught by a very shocked boy at 3rd man [we shall be working on not giving away your wicket at the weekend]. 288 with our bowling attack was a big ask for any team to reach.</div> <div style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"">Our opening attack was accurate## fierce and in some instances very fast. we were giving nothing away in terms of runs ## but a few byes and a couple of wides allowed them to reach 213 after 12 overs## wickets fell to Thomas## Matthew##Louis ##Archie##Sebastian [Wicket Maiden]##Max FE [3 wickets] and Oliver. By the 16th over they were on 216## the last two batsmen came in with nothing to lose and with Oliver and Raphi bowling the last four overs there could be runs and wickets with the batsmen edging and running every ball Ballinger style. They put on some brave runs which took them to a more respectable 247.</div> <div style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"">A solid win for Ballinger against a decent opposition in some challenging conditions. Sebastian Phillips deserves a mention for textbook leg spin and Oliver managed his team and bowling order extremely well which &nbsp;clearly added to the result## our fielding was good## but we have been better and we need to support the team by being sharper## as this again is worth runs to us.</div> <div style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"">A fun match with a fun and friendly opposition## such a good experience for everyone.

1142,<p>It was back down to earth with a bump for the Seconds this week## as a depleted team travelled to league leaders ##Waddesdon. Another new opening pair combined the experienced Nigel with new found opener Matt. Nigel's early departure## set the tone for the afternoon as a rather puzzled Matt watched his partners return## one by one to the hutch. What was so difficult ? Sure the track was slow and wet and the outfield cavernous but Matt continued to make it look easy. No-one could stay with him## as we all found novel ways to get out. He reached his 50 with six wickets down and when he finally perished to an outstanding catch he was the 9th wicket down.</p> <p>With conditions improving as the wicket dried out Ballinger needed a decent start - Reece Tiley## returning after 2 years out through injury## duly served a wicket up in the first over. A fine spell from the other end from Will Arnold backed up him up and after 12 overs Waddesdon were struggling at 19-1. However we were always a bowler light and despite another tight spell from Matt## the string of part time bowlers were pushed around the park without too much difficulty although there was a promising debut from Will Russell. The youthful (for the most part !) Ballinger team received a harsh lesson in running between the wickets from Cadmore refugee Spike who showed whats possible as we struggled to stem the quick singles. It only served to highlight the missed runs in the Ballinger innings. By the time the skipper belatedly brought back his main bowlers the bird had flown and Waddesdon cruised to 136 -1.</p> <p>A disappointing end to what had promised at one time to be a good performance. However it was decent weather in a peaceful setting## even if we had only Matt's 50## the first of many hopefully ## to savour</p> <p></p>,,2014-06-15
1159,<p>On the face of it## to lose narrowly to league leaders Waddesdon might be construed as encouraging. The reality was that&nbsp;Waddesdon were missing five of their regular side## as became evident when## opting to field first## they put down a hatful of catches## which## if held## would have put Ballinger in trouble. As it was## Ballinger put on 71 for their first wicket## without either opener looking really comfortable## against a steady attack. Matt Riley was first to depart## edging to the keeper for a somewhat fortunate 20. Andy Thompson followed three overs later## leg before## soon after reaching an excellent half century## and efforts to up the scoring rate proved difficult especially against Adnam## whose 10 overs cost only 17 runs##- 9 of which were no balls! Carlton soon left## also LBW## making it 104 for 3## with 33 overs gone. Rollo## however## was going well## continuing his form from the previous week## and making the most of the few scoring opportunities on offer. The Waddesdon captain then made a game-altering bowling change by bringing himslf on. With Nick Adams having been promoted to accelerate the run-rate## the combination was electrifying. The last 7 overs of the innings went for 75## 46 of them off the hapless skipper's 3 overs. Rollo finshed unbeaten on 42 including 3 sixes and## and Nick on 27 (2 sixes). A 40-over total of 179 was by far Ballinger's highest of the season##and hopes were high for victory.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Waddesdon openers looked to be in little trouble## and scored relatively freely## but a change of bowling earned the first wicket with the total on 45## when Carlton struck in his first over. The next change had the same outcome## when skipper Ian Maciver's first over was a wicket maiden## to make it 67 for 2## and only 14 overs bowled.There followed a lengthy partnership between the aggressive opener Atkinson and Irwin## which looked to be tilting the march Waddesdon's way until Irwin was run out from a direct hit by boundary fielder dead-eye Matt Riley## as he had the nerve to take a second run. Ian Maciver was by now keeping the batsmen almost scoreless (after 8 overs he had conceded a mere 5 runs and taken 3 wickets!)## but runs at the other end kept the scoreboard moving. Ballinger's fielding was## on the whole## rather sloppy## but there followed two exceptions: a superb catch by Will Reid## hurling himself full-length on the boundary## and another good run-out## this time from a fine&nbsp;return by Rollo.&nbsp; Nick returned to the attack and took a wicket## as did Evan Webster## but still the runs kept coming. Eight wickets were down## the batsmen were grabbing every chance to steal singles## and the match could go either way. And so it continued## amidst great tension##&nbsp;until one run was needed off the final ball of the 40th and final over. It was successfully run## and Ballinger were left to rue the 33 extras conceded## which in the end had cost them the game.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-06-15
1253,<p>Overcast at shardaloes ## but a very warm and friendly welcome from the Amersham players. Our Captain Sebastian won the toss and chose to field. Thomas B's first over was a double wicket maiden and Amershams woes continued from there on. More wickets fell to Matthew[2]## Edward##Louis##Max and Sebastian [3] and a fine wicket maiden to Finn Henry. Some excellent run outs by Louis and Archie and Hannah. We also had the pleasure of having Hannah Bates one of our great girl players who bowled on the stumps every ball. amersham never really managed to get going and we only gave away 9 extras## some may say 9 too many## but at this level of the game it is still better than most othe rteams## but an area still to work on. Amersham Finished on 200.&nbsp;</p> <p>I expected our side to get to around 280 and from the start we never looked like doing anything apart from continuing to command the field. Finn and Edward took us up to 220## Matthew and Louis up to 228## Tim and Seb pushed us further on to 255## Max and Hanna moved us on to 268 and Thomas and Archie finished the innings off on 293. I lost the bet of ending on 280## but we dont always get it right.</p> <p>Well done to all of the boys and special thanks to Hannahs parents and Hannah and also to Nick and tim Hayes for stepping in at the last moment.</p>,,2014-06-15

1197,<p>On yet another sunny evening the home team won the toss and put Ballinger in to bat on what looked a decent track. Early indications confirmed as much as Max and Monty put on 41 runs in 6 overs before Monty was caught off a thick edge to the keeper. Hamish joined Max in the middle and they put on 17 quick runs before Max fell to a great delivery## Ballinger 58 for 2 off 8 overs. Ben was next up and he and Hamish set about the Ley Hill attack## helped by some erratic bowling and loose fielding the pair put on 85 runs in 12 overs before Ben&nbsp;is unluckily run out. Matt joined Hamish for the remaining 5 balls with Hamish in touching distance of his 50. Another 7 runs were added with Hamish finishing on 52 not out## a great innings. Ballinger 150 for 3 off their 20 overs.</p> <p>Although a decent total Ley Hill were in confident mood with their openers Joe Batt and Will Price looking to take on the Ballinger attack. Both looked to be in good nick before Batt had his stumps re-arranged by a great delivery from Will Reid. Callum Wilson next to the crease and he and Price continued to take on the Ballinger bowling. The score 51 for 1 off 6 overs and Ley Hill up with the required rate before the dangerous Price## trying to hit Hamish down the ground##&nbsp;was well caught by Matt O'Kelly. 51 for 2 soon becomes 57 for 3 as Wilson has his stumps re-arranged this time by Hamish. With Ley Hills big hitters back in the pavilion it was up to Matt Burr to try and salvage something for the home side. Ley Hill now 58 for 4 off 10 overs. Captain Ben Dugdale feeling the game was now in control varied his bowling options. Ley hill putting on a further&nbsp;19 runs off 4 overs before the next wicket## 77 for 5 off 14 overs. A further 34 runs in the next 5 overs take the home side to 111 before wicket 6 tumbles&nbsp;with 1 over remaining. Will Reid to do the honours## 2 dot balls## wicket## wicket## hat trick a strong possibility## the fielders surround the incoming bat Brandon Tuberville but he manages to keep out the next 2 deliveries and Ley Hill finish on 111 for 8 off their 20 overs.</p> <p>A convincing&nbsp;performance&nbsp;by Ballinger both with bat and ball. Man of the Match undoubtably Hamish but everyone played their part.

1143,<p>Playing 9 man Prestwood should have been a straightforward assignment## but not for the first time the Seconds made hard work of it at times. The opposition won the toss and unsurprisingly opted to take first knock## and fuelled by an aggressive innings from Spur they raced to 49 without loss off the first 7 overs. A wicket maiden from Fin slowed things down## but the real turning point came with a farcical run out at the start of the 14th over## that saw the end of Spur for 50## Fin with an accurate throw leaving him stranded. Ballinger were then able to tighten the screw through Ben and Andy. Wickets fell at regular intervals in a fine spell of bowling from Andy Rowe who took his fifth and sixth wickets with consecutive balls and then looked forlornly as no more Prestwood batsmen emerged from the pavillion.</p> <p>Back out to bat with 40 minutes before tea## we made a bit of a mess of it as the openers decided they wanted to enjoy their tea without having to worry about the Prestwood bowling attack. A fine tea## courtesy of Fiona who's contribution at that stage exceeded that of her eldest son## was quickly followed by the return of Marcus &amp; Steve 'dude' Carter to the hutch. 34 for 4. Time to go on the attack we felt. Ben and Dom - who clearly wanted to take some measure of revenge - quickly took the score past 100 before Ben went for a big swing. When he opened his eyes his stumps had been rearranged. Fin joined Dom##who raced to his 50 and finished the match with a six.</p> <p>A reasonable performance and a satisfying result. An outstanding spell from Andy backed up by Fin and Josh in particular## and responsible innings from Dom and Ben saw us home comfortably in the end.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-06-22
1160,<p>England humiliated in the World Cup; smashed by the All Blacks; McIlroy missed the cut.....could life get any worse for Wendover CC## without a win in the league so far? Could Ballinger grab some easy points to boost their own shaky league position? Read on...</p> <p>Ian Davies returning## more sun-tanned than ever## to lead his men## won the toss and decided to give his bowlers first go. They did not disappoint him. Opener Patel## surviving a&nbsp;snick to the&nbsp;keeper&nbsp;off Will Reid's first ball## which only the umpire failed to detect## took root in a display of astonishing immobility## falling for a duck after facing 33 dot balls##&nbsp;in the 14th over##&nbsp; with the total on 19! His fellow opener went next over## for&nbsp; a more respectable 17## although he too had at one time faced 35 balls in scoring 1. Nick Adams conceded only one run off his first 5 overs## and though finishing wicket-less## his 10 over spell cost just 10 runs. Ian Maciver had come on to replace Will Reid in the 14th over; &nbsp;the Wendover batsmen found him virtually unplayable## and his figures of 5 for 15 in his 10 overs were proof of a superb spell of spin bowling. With half their overs gone Wendover had only 26 runs on the board## with three wickets down## so the fact that their second 20 overs yielded a further 84 was proof that their later batsmen were determined to make a game of it.</p> <p>However## a target of 111 on what had proved to be a pitch with no demons in it was evidently one that Ballinger could tackle with confidence. Unfortunately for Andy Thompson## already suffering from some unkind late-order abuse of his bowling## the pitch now decided to deal him a grubber## castling him for a confident 7. This was&nbsp;an ideal&nbsp;opportunity for fellow opener Richard O'Kelly to bat himself back into form## which is exactly what he did## whilst Rollo continued with his own fine form## and the pair of them gave a delightful batting exhibition## looking to have won the game## when both departed bowled## unexpectedly## leaving the match to be won amid a flurry of extras## with 12 overs to spare.</p> <p>A thoroughly excellent all-round display by Ballinger.

Keep pressure on the opposition all of the time## you never know when/if they might fall over.

Ballinger winning the toss and captain Will Smith deciding to bat## then opting for youth to open the innings with Hamish and Max. Hamish unluckily going early## misjudging the pace of the ball on to the bat and catching a thick edge for an easy catch. Danny Draper joining&nbsp;Max in the middle with the pair adding 95 runs before Danny was caught## Ballinger 95 for 2 off 16 overs. Will Smith next to the crease with Max now established after some early scares. Max and Will putting on 121 runs in the next 16 overs before Max edges to the keeper looking to push the score along but not before hitting Rivetts best bowler Bilal for 25 in one over## closing in on his century with tea fast approaching. It was a very well crafted 112 including 13 fours and 4 sixes in a total of 92 balls faced. Will was next to go falling 3 short of his 50 in a solid innings that took a while to get started. Further wickets fell as Ballinger tried to push the score along in the final 15 minutes before tea## Ballinger finishing on 249 for 7 off 38 overs.</p> <p>After an enjoyable tea provided by Graham## Rivetts took up the challenge. They were quick out the blocks scoring 36 in 5 overs before the first wicket## followed by wickets 2 and 3 in quick succession## the score now 38 for 3 after 6 overs. A further 27 runs were added before wicket 4## Rivetts 65 for 4 off 10 overs with Ballinger seemingly in controi. Ateeq## still in the middle and scoring freely was joined by captain Quasim with the pair adding 82 runs off the next 15 overs## the score 147 for 5 off 25 overs with 11 overs remaining. Wicket 6 fell 2 balls later but Ateeq was still scoring freely and now joined by Bilal## seemingly recovered from his mauling by Max earlier in the day. The pair adding 27 runs before the important wicket of Ateeq## out for 83## caught by Hamish of the as ever economical bowling of Stuart McGowan. With the score on 175 for 7 with 8 overs to go Bilal looked to take a more cautious approach. Ballinger looked to attack the other end and were rewared with wicket 8. Bilal looked solid as Ballinger continued to try and attack the weaker end but were without success until the final over## bowled by Hamish## with Bilal LBW off the first ball. 5 balls remaining##&nbsp;1 wicket needed## bats 10 and 11 at the crease with Hamish giving it all he had. Rivetts managed to survive and earned a hard fought draw.</p> <p>A great game## Ballinger with some wayward bowling at times and a few dropped catches had their chances to win the game but credit to Rivetts for initially trying to chase down a challenging total before eventually playing out for the draw.</p>,,2014-06-23
1238,<p>Ballinger Girls were in the unusual situation of fielding first. Charlotte and Hattie opened the bowling and had Burnham 17 for 3 off 6. Burnham then had what looked like an unlikely partnership in 10 overs to take them to 81 before tha fall of the next wicket at 16 overs. From here Burnham continued to score and amassed 106 runs .</p> <p>Although a big score## the boundaries were small and everyone knew how easy it could be with Georgina scoring 10 in the first over. This soon became 30 well crafted runs and then retired. Hannah continued getting runs even if her calling was not as crisp as usual. Hannah run out for 25 and the Tillty soon back on the boundary. Charlotte scored 14 runs but was also run out. At 87 for 3 off 13 overs everyone knew the win was just 2 overs away. The runs however dried up Jane was out for 0## Sophie survived 12 balls for her 1 before she was bowled. The winning runs were eventually scored by Lucy a very cleanly hit 4 off the first ball she faced. With 3 balls to spare Ballinger had held their nerve and just got home. A massive congratulations to Hattie for organising the tail as she had done on Sunday when she was involved in a lst wicket partnership of over 40 out of her teams total of 100.</p>,,2014-06-24

Hamish in next with Max carrying on where he left off on Sunday and the pair putting on 44 in the next 6 overs. Max getting to 30 in quick time before being stumped. Ben joining Hamish in the middle and both continuing to take on the Cublington attack## adding a further 32 in 4 overs before Ben is caught## Ballinger 77 for 3 off 10 overs. Things looking good for Ballinger but how quickly that can change## Dom and Connor come and go in quick time## Ballinger 95 for 5 off 13 overs. Toby Lyons now joining Hamish with Ballinger hoping for another decent partnership. Hamish departs with the score still on 95 and things not looking so promising. Matt O'Kelly up next and he and Toby add a quick 16 in the next 2 overs before Matt has his stumps re-arranged. Toby looking in good nick is joined by Josh Richardson## making his U17 re-appearance## doesn't stay long with Ballinger now on 115 for 8 off 16 overs. Will Reid up next and finds it hard getting bat on ball. Fortunately at the other end Toby is playing beautifully and the pair take the score to 148 without any further mishaps## Toby finishing on 24 not out and giving Ballinger a total to defend on a good batting track and fast outfield.</p> <p>Cublington took to the middle&nbsp;with Ballinger knowing they had to make a good start and so they did with Will Reid## Hamish## Dom and Will Arnold all making it difficult for the opposition. Pressure mounted and wickets fell and Cublington finding themselves 55 for 5 off 12 covers. Ben## Monty and Josh joined the party with the final score ending on 99 for 5 off their 20 overs. It was an excellent display by the four front line bowlers backed up by some great fielding and a team in positive mood with lots of encouragement throughout making it even more difficult for Cublington.</p> <p>Hopefully they can take all that was good in this game to the cup meeting with Gerrards Cross next Tuesday.</p>,,2014-06-25

First to arrive at the ground was Andrew Strauss who was great signing the boys bats and doing selfies and pictures with all the boys. This set the warm tone for what turned out to be a very competetive but friendly game.</p> <p>Whilst Marlow warmed up with the ex England Captain our boys started arriving from school trips and matches in Northwood##speedily delivered by Nick HAyes and Nick Tatum.&nbsp;</p> <p>We batted first and Oliver and Tim put us on 229## Archie and Seb up to 257 after 8 overs## Raphi and Max FE pushed us up to 294 from 12 overs## we still hadnt lost a wicket and Marlow were at a complete loss what to do. Finn and Kuran faced some very accurtate bowling and we held on 292## then in came Max C and Thoimas B who drove the total up to 334## our highest ever score.</p> <p>I thought that 260 would win this match## but the boys had other ideas.</p> <p>Our bowling was suoerb## everyone bowled a good line and lenght and Oliver managed his bowlers like a veteran captain. Oliver threw a ball in from at least 40 yards for a direct strike running out Sam Strauss and so Marlows woes began## Kurans first ball bowled Sam Strauss ## then Finn took a wicket and Max stumped another. 12 overs gone and they are on 237## more tight bowling and by over 17 they were on 257## 4 overs to go and then Sebastin takes an amazing catch followed by 2 more catches taken by Finn## Raphi and Oliver finished proceedings with them still on 257.</p> <p>Oliver 23 &nbsp; Archie 10 &nbsp; Seb &nbsp;13 &nbsp; Raphi &nbsp;14 &nbsp;Max FE 16</p> <p>Max C 20</p> <p>Wickets</p> <p>Finn 3 &nbsp; Raphi 2 Kuran 1 &nbsp;Oliver 1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2014-06-27
1222,<p>Samuel won the toss on debut as Captain and put GK into bat. Philip and David opened with some good tight overs## but did not look like displacing their solid openers. As we entered the 5-10 overs their opener began to take it away from Ballinger## and though William and Samuel were able to take some wickets## the GK batsmen had accelerated the score considerably. The innings total of 135 did not feel like a correct total for the bowling that we had sent down. Ballinger felt that they could try to chase down the total if they kept their wickets.&nbsp;</p> <p>The early loss of Philip to some very fast bowling from their captain and the subsequent restraint that put on our batsmen stopped our momentum. Their wk took a couple of knocks to the helmet## so Philip went on as sub fielder. Over the next few overs Philip then took two good catches at midwicket## but in doing so## cut short Theo and Will in their prime. Samuel continued bravely and retired at 30. From there## the less experience batsmen simply had too much to do. We reached 86 for 9## but were left feeling that it could and should have been closer.&nbsp;</p> <p>A game of cricket played in the very best spirit## well done boys.</p> <p>Sharks</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-06-28
1221,<p>The team looked very flat this Monday rvening## which affected the fielding and bowling and also a pretty lacklustre run chase. The boys have got to learn to support each other.......it is a team game. The HW batsman raced off to a flying start and both retired at 30. Ballinger did well to claw back the rest of the batsman and claim seven wickets## in the end## the 45+ of extras we conceded meant that an evening run chase of 124 was just too much.</p> <p>Another very solid batting performance from Samuel underpinned the innings## but a combination of a low sun in the eyes and some poor shot selection meant we did not reach the heights.&nbsp;</p> <p>Let's bring back some enthusiasm and energy into our last two games of the season.</p> <p>Sharks</p>,,2014-06-28
1226,<p>I cannot say more than pointing out there were 82 dot balls in our innings. Their out fied cricket was good## but not that good. Calling## running## pressurising the fielder .......this is all part of cricket</p>,,2014-06-28

1255,<p><strong>We could have filled a pond with the amount of ducks we had today</strong>## but our annual Beaconsfield 12 a side friendly and they arrived straight from training with 11 motivated boys## our Finn won the toss and chose to bat first. We were fielding a team of five of our great U9 players and the other 7 from our U10 squad. Playing normal rules with boys retiring on 30 ## well Beaconsfield had clearly been working on their bowling and our wickets started to fall at too rapid a rate## we limped into the 20th over with Max Conway on 39 and Daniel Battman supporting him with some confident batting both walked off not out. Our second highest scorer behind Max was Extras followed by Thomas on 5.&nbsp;</p> <p>79## we have not much of a chance the crowd thought## anyway we loaded our players with juice and some very yummy cup cakes and we took to the field## controlled and guided by a very precise captain Finn Henry## he had a plan and he was going to put it into action## which he did.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tight and accurate bowling from Thomas## Finn and Kuran kept the run rate right down and then as he planned he gace all of the boys a bown## the first breakthrough came to Edward Best with his spin## then the flood gates started with most of the boys taking wickets and giving almost nothing away. Max FE was almost unplayable for their batsmen## Louis Barton caused all sorts of problems for them and Leo##Noah##Daniel and Tobywere never phased by their openers.</p> <p>Beaconsfield just couldnt get runs passed out superb fielders performing textbook stops## noticeably Noah Henry## James Best. Great catches from Daniel and possibly catch of the season when second ball from Finn to a fierce looking batsman was edged## it clipped Max behind the stumps and Thoimas Berens at first slip dived to take it.</p> <p>Beaconsfield never looked like ever reaching their target and Finn's field placement was genius and never allowed them to ever get started.</p> <p>A big thanks you as well to all the parents## but especially Freddie Hancock who kindly played for Beaconsfield## he was an outstanding sportsman all day. &nbsp;</p> <p>Note to self - defensive stroke training for boys</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-06-29
1254,<p>A late change of venue kindly provided by Beaconsfield CC and a warm summers evening## so everything in place for our last league fixture.</p> <p>Oliver won the toss and chose to field## and Knotty Green to to the beautifully prepared pitch. Our opening bowlers allowed them to get to 220 after the first four overs and KG appeared fairly optimistic## could they be the giant killers## sadly for them matters started to get worse as Ballinger moved up a gear## wicket maiden from Thomas## wicket maiden from Archie## then an amazing high backward diving catch from Archie at Long Off from Thomas's second maiden over## Sebastian's gps accurate bowling led to a superb direct hit run out from Archie ## it was over 10 and they were down to 202## Finn came on and his first maiden over 3 wickets &nbsp;fall## a great catch from Tim a run out by Max and then middle stump is bowled## down to 189## they managed to recover a little after over 13 and we took no further wickets## they finished on 221 following more tight bowling from Tim## Seb##Matthew##Leo and Oliver. Thomas handled the last over which was his final maiden.</p> <p>Ballinger came in to bat after taking on fluids## Archie and Thomas finished their four overs on 227## so we had already beaten the target## Knotty then put on their best stint putting Matthew and Leo under some pressure## sadly this was the session where we lost our only wickets of the match## but the boys did well and Matthew punished the last bowler with a great four off his legs## leaving us on 218. Knotty felt there was hope## sadly they didn't realise what was awaiting them## Finn and Kuran came in both boys finding the boundary with ease Finn adding 18 [from 13] and Kuran 20 [from 11] taking us up to 256## Knotty then hoped that was the end of our batsmen[one of the boys asked me if they could all bat##i smiled and said &ldquo;Oh Yes&rdquo;## he replied with &ldquo;Oh Dear&rdquo;]## in came a highly charged Sebastian and Max## Seb put on 22 [from 14] and Max 11 [from 10] leaving us on 289## then came in the really big guns## some very slow wide bowling prevented sixes galore## but Oliver scored 24 [from 13] and Tim scored 19 [from 12] leaving us on 332## 111 ahead of Knotty Green.</p> <p>What strikes me about our team is not the fact that they keep winning ## but that they just all play so well as a side ## knowing each others strengths and weaknesses## with the pairs knowing how their partner bats to the captain Oliver bowling his players at the right time to get the best results.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unbeaten in the league and on to the finals day on the 20th July.</p>,,2014-07-02
1274,<p>What appears&nbsp;a convincing win for Gerrards Cross could have been a different story if not for a dropped catch at a crucial point in the game.</p> <p>Although not at full strength Gerrards Cross was always going to be a tough encounter. Winning the toss and chosing to bat GX found themselves 44 for 3 off 8 overs with three of their top four batsmen back in the pavilion. Ben Lane batting at three still there and looking to push the innings on. In the tenth over with the score on 56## with Lane on 19## he skies the ball## two fielders close in## one calls## but the ball slips agonisingly through his fingers. I highlight this incident because Ben Lane then goes on to score 109 not out off 51 balls## including 11 fours and 7 sixes## plundering the Ballinger bowling. GX finishing on 191 for 4 off their 20 overs.</p> <p>A bruised Ballinger take to the middle needing nearly 10 runs an over. A good start essential to make any challenge but sadly not to be with Ballingers top three back in the pavilion with the score on 9 off 3 overs. Ben Dugdale and Dom Brown manage to put on a 73 run partnership and take the score to 82 in the 15th over before Ben is caught. With a slightly more respecatable score on the board Ballinger then try and push the score along## further wickets fall and Ballinger finish on 120 for 8.</p> <p>An enjoyable game## played in good spirit on a sunny evening. GX through to the next round## Ballinger live to fight another day. What might have been we'll never know but as the saying goes ' catches win matches'.</p>,,2014-07-02

&nbsp;<br /><br />In the field## the girls generally stopped everything that came their way. &nbsp;Laura has become a specialist mid-off and the batsmen learned not to take runs from her - she will be nursing a few bruises today as she put her body on the line time and again. &nbsp;Lucy seemed to get a lot of the action and dealt with it well. &nbsp;In general the girls were committed when the ball was coming to them but I would like to see them up this to a more aggressive and dynamic display to stop the balls wide of them.&nbsp; Poppy once again kept the byes down - just 3 compared to the oppositions 8.<br /><br />Containing a fine batting team to just 99 runs was a result but the best was yet to come.&nbsp;<br /><br />The girls have found batting tough this season - struggling to get bat on ball## moving their feet. &nbsp;In this innings## they looked like a different team. &nbsp;Every single girl connected with the ball this time and not only that## they were moving their feet and playing with a straight bat. &nbsp;Livy and Nicky started well but both out Caught and Bowled for 2 each. &nbsp;The middle order collapse - Charlotte C## Ellie## Laura and Poppy - does not tell the story that all four of them had a decent amount of time at the crease during which they ran byes and they were all playing good looking strokes which kept finding fielders. &nbsp;On a different day## they would have all got runs. &nbsp;Charlotte R (with Nicky as a runner) had her best innings of the season and scored the first ever 4 for the team - looked like she was going to score a lot of runs but was then bowled by a ball which pitched a foot outside off stump - Charlotte Edwards (current England Captain) would have struggled with that one. &nbsp;Just as it looked like## Ballinger might run out of steam## in comes Isabel and gave a master class in stroke play## including hitting probably the best shot of the day (from both sides)## a perfectly executed front foot cover drive for four. &nbsp;Millie did a sterling job at the other end## scoring singles and giving Isabel the opportunity to get our top score of the season - 13. &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy scored her first ever run in a league game and Annie was unlucky to get a tall bowler with a lot of bounce - but she still connected! &nbsp;I am not sure what has happened since the last game but I can only assume that the Mums and Dads have been out in the garden helping them with technique - it was a huge improvement. &nbsp;They should all feel very proud. &nbsp;54 equals our best score of the season but this time over 5 times more runs came off the bat!&nbsp;<br /><br />Once again## we were lucky to have a very sporting opposition. &nbsp;Both the Stoke Green boys and coaches were fantastic and supportive - I think everyone enjoyed themselves.</span></p>",,2014-07-04
1239,<p>On a beautiful Friday evening Ballinger Girls opened the batting with Tilly and Georgina. Tilly was soon retired on 32 and Georgina went on and scored 18. This brought Hannah and Hattie to the wicket and Hannah was also soon retired on 31 and Hattie also made 18 which left Jane and Charlotte to face the last few balla. A commanding total of 135 for 2.</p> <p>At the beginning of their innings the scoreboard kept pace with the run rate. Georgina was bowling good line and length as was Hannah. First change had Charlotte who wasn't bowling at her best but got a wicket. Hattie took over from Georgina and then the wickets started to tumble. Chalfont St Peter had no answer to Hatties nagggingly accurate left arm bowling. Jane took a good catch for Hatties first wicket## bowled the next ball## so on to a hat trick. It didn't happen but the 3rd wicket came on the 4th ball. Hattie continued## took another wicket and was bowled through her 4 overs to see if she could get a 5th. She could and a 6th next ball. Hat trick ball again. But again not converted. Hattie was carried off by her team mates when Chalfont St Peter were bowled out for 79 with Hattie having figures of 6 for 6 off 4 overs.&nbsp;</p> <p>A great batting disply topped off by Hatties bowling.</p>,,2014-07-05
1279,<p>Knotty Green were allowed in to the league at last minute and we didnt have time to sort out a team so game was agreed to be called 'Rained Off'</p>,,2014-07-06
1162,<p>Another rainy Saturday morning after a sunny week## and a sense of deja-vu. The difference this week was that the rain had been much lighter## so after a heavy shower had delayed the start of&nbsp;proceedings##the game got under way with little time lost## and Ballinger opting to bowl first on a wicket that would prove to be a tricky one## due to the ends having been covered## but not so the middle. Holmer Green's openers immediately started to chance their arms&nbsp;against Nick Adams and Will Reid## the latter particularly having cause to think the Fate was against him## as the ball flew regularly to the boundary## edged over or between the slip cordon. The total had sped to 56 in the 11th over when keeper Max Dugdale grasped the first of two excellent catches## the second following at 79 in the 17th over. By this time Carlton Siddle had come on## and immediately applied a stranglehold which## try as they could## the HG batsmen simply couldn't break. Max## standing up to the bowling##also shackled the batsmen## and Ian Maciver## replacing Nick## was immediately into his stride and keeping the batsmen guessing. From the 20th over the next 16 overs yielded&nbsp;only 32 runs## while 2 wickets fell## so that with only 4 overs left the total was a mere 121 for 5## and Ballinger's tails were up. Unfortunately Kevin King## long-time destroyer of Ballinger hopes## now entered the fray## and the last 4 overs went for 49 costly runs## so that HG finished on a respectable 170 for 6.</p> <p>Sadly## Ballinger's reply never got past first base## with none of the first four batsmen able to cope with a ball lifting sharply off the pitch## and whereas the HG batsmen edged&nbsp;to the boundary## Ballinger's edged straight to the keeper## who pouched 5 catches in the innings. Coming together at 25 for 4## Carlton and Jamie Kellock steadied the ship for a while## managing to put on 23 for the 5th wicket## but Carlton was then bowled by Weeracoon's second delivery## and Jamie who had been judiciously mixing vigilant defence with some flashing off-drives## then decided on a spot of hara-kiri## and ran himself needlessly out. That his 17 was the top score (save for Extras 20 !) says it all of the remaining batting## which subsided to a dispiriting all out 85.</p> <p>To lose## having scored only 50% of the required target## must be counted as a pretty miserable defeat## but Lady Luck was certainly not favouring Ballinger## with the number of near chances## and a couple of very hard dropped catches. Overall the fielding was excellent ## and Max's keeping superlative##&nbsp;conceding no byes&nbsp;on a difficult wicket. Carlton's bowling performance of 10 overs## 1 wicket for 5 runs was surely deserving of a far better fate than the batsmen were able to deliver!</p>,,2014-07-06

1180,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ballinger&rsquo;s team of teenagers## leavened with a trio of men in their 40s comprehensively outplayed Hyde Heath&rsquo;s team of men in their 20s and 30s. &nbsp;It was a pleasure to captain a team of skilled and athletic young cricketers who know how to play the game well and enjoy themselves at the same time.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ballinger won the toss and decided to bat## despite there still being plenty of dampness in a pitch which had been very wet and difficult to bat on the day before. &nbsp;However## after some early misbehaviour## the pitch settled down. Ballinger&rsquo;s total of 204 for 6 from 41 overs was built largely around 3 very skilful but very different innings. &nbsp;James McIntyre## coming in at number 3## built the foundations of the Ballinger total with a careful but stylish 51 off 90 balls## assisted in particular by Ben Dugdale at number 5.&nbsp; Ben was fourth man out at Nelson (111) after 25.3 overs.&nbsp; Toby Lyons initially supported James well and then accelerated towards the end of the innings to score a focussed 40 not out off 45 balls.&nbsp; After James was fifth man out at 153 after 34 overs## Monty Thompson joined Toby and scored a bludgeoning 31 off 26 balls to contribute to a nicely-timed acceleration in the last 10 overs of the Ballinger innings to produce a challenging but eminently gettable total.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Hyde Heath gave the impression of being just a little bit too confident in their ability to overhaul it. Ballinger opened with a pace and spin combination in the form of Hamish Sim and Stuart McGowan; and Hamish struck in the third over as opener Haddock unwisely left a ball that pitched on off stump and hit off stump.&nbsp; Hyde Heath showed intent from the start but lost another wicket to Hamish on 25## as a catch was spooned to James McIntyre at a deliberately straight extra cover.&nbsp;&nbsp; There then followed a threatening partnership of 48 for the third wicket## which was ended by an excellent piece of fielding on the boundary from Hamish## sending in a fast flat throw to Stuart at the bowler&rsquo;s end &nbsp;&ndash; typical of Ballinger&rsquo;s excellent fielding throughout the afternoon.&nbsp; There then followed a clatter of wickets at 74## 82## 91## 97 and 106## as Hyde Heath continued to pursue the total but without the ability to cope with the accurate offspin of Stuart McGowan from one end and the equally accurate legspin from Freddie Thompson at the other. &nbsp;Stuart ended with 3 for 44 &nbsp;and Freddie 3 for 26. &nbsp;Both were assisted by excellent close catching - including a sharp catch by keeper Max Dugdale and 2 superb one handed diving catches at slip by one of Ballinger&rsquo;s athletic old pros## Rob McIntyre. &nbsp;&nbsp;After the ninth wicket fell at 121 in the 28th over## Hyde Heath gave up the chase and Ballinger were left with 13 overs to take the last wicket. &nbsp;Nearly everything had gone right in the first 28 overs## but there Ballinger&rsquo;s luck turned &hellip;.. &nbsp;Number 9 Rauf batted with some skill to end up not out 38## while number 11## and Hyde Heath skipper## Samuels essentially played French cricket to great effect for 13 overs## to deny Ballinger the win that they deserved.&nbsp; Seven bowlers were used in the last 13 overs in an attempt to dislodge them. With hindsight the skipper should have persisted with the spin of Freddie and Stuart for longer## as the quicker bowlers went past the bat frequently but failed actually to hit the stumps and the less penetrating seamers bowled admirably straight but could not do enough to get through the Hyde Heath defences. &nbsp;It was a shame not to win## but that was not allowed to mar an excellent performance in all departments by a very young team. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,2014-07-07
1200,<p>Ballinger won the toss and chose to bat in this top of the table clash.</p> <p>Max and Monty got off to a decent start putting on 27 runs in the 4th over before Monty## tempted outside his off stump## nicked one to the keeper. Toby in next and 19 runs added before Toby's bails are removed. Ben next up to join his brother with plenty of banter from the opposition## Ben on his way back to the pavilion 2 balls later after trying to launch one back over the bowler to be caught on the boundary## Ballinger 46 for 3 off 9 overs. Matt to the middle to join Max and the pair looking to push the rate along. Max## now timing the ball well## middles one back down the ground to be brilliantly caught by Fraser Percival diving high and wide and holding on to the ball in what looked a certain six## Ballinger 65 for 4 off 12. Dom Brown now moved up the order to try and gain some momentum. He and Matt adding another 40 runs in 6 overs before Matt has his stumps re-arranged. Kenny to the middle with 2 overs remaining and his brief to get Dom on strike. Another 25 runs added before Kenny is run out with 1 ball remaining. Ballinger finishing on 130 for 6 off their 20 overs## with Dom 44 not out off 29 balls.</p> <p>A decent total to defend but important Ballinger get off to a good start and what a start it was. Will Reid's first ball unplayable and clatters the stumps of a bemused Henry Quinn. The next four deliveries not bad either## followed by another rocket that has Eddie Mason LBW## The Lee 0 for 2 off 1 over. Freddie DS bowling from the other end giving nothing away to a shell shocked opposition. Will on for his second over and removes Tom Houghton## bowled off his pads## The Lee 4 for 3 off 3 overs. Jamie Line in next## questioning the legality of Will's action## only to be caught by Will off Freddie DS## not a happy bunny as he returns to the pavilion## the Lee 8 for 4 off 4. Freddie T now to bowl and excellent spell to add to The Lee's troubles. Will Young and Tom Line put up some resistance but wickets fall at regular intervals. The clouds darken and rain begins to fall but not in time as The Lee finish on 68 all out## with Josh Richardson taking the final wicket in the 19th over.</p> <p>Another great perfomance by the team and a game played in good spirirt.</p>,,2014-07-09
1163,<p>Ballinger slipped a little further down the greasy pole of relegation on Saturday when they lost badly to fellow strugglers Monks Risborough. Influenced perhaps by the relative batting strength of his side compared with his bowling line up## acting skipper Andy Thompson chose to take first knock## on a hot sunny afternoon## a decision regretted by the third over## by which time BWCC had lost both openers Matt Riley (unluckily deflecting a wide ball onto his stumps) and Richard O'Kelly (castled by near unplayable delivery)## both victims of the accurate&nbsp;J Iqbal.&nbsp; Rollo McIntyre and Andy Thompson set about repairing the damage## with Rollo looking again in fine form. But with the total on 37## both fell in the 11th over## with Monty Thomson perishing soon after## LBW without opening his account## and&nbsp;the scoreboard reading 45 for 5. Enter Max Dugdale and Dom Brown## two youngsters without any batting form in the 1sts to date## and who evidently had the same idea## namely to justify selection - which they did in an emphatic way.&nbsp; The pair had put on 46 for the 6th wicket before Dom fell## LBW for an excellent 22## and Max's classy knock came to an end after batting exactly an hour for an invaluable 28.Fortunate indeed that he eventually managed to locate the ground## after an abortive&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;the middle of Aylesbury! &nbsp;That made it 104 for 7## and the remaining wickets went down within 6 more overs## to leave Ballinger with a highly vulnerable score of 127. Had the Monks' fielding and catching been better## it might well have been less!</p> <p>Monks started their innings just as badly as Ballinger. with Nick Adams grabbing a couple of quick scalps## and Will Reid joining in with one## so that with the score standing at 16 for 3 prospects for a favourable outcome were good. First change bowler Andy Thompson struck in his first over## but by that time the total was already 55## and thereafter the bowlers could find no way of stopping H Amjad (50) and B Khan (38) who cruised undefeated&nbsp;to their target in only the 26th over. Had Ballinger had their two missing regular bowlers available## the result might well have been closer## but there is no denying that Monks Risborough played the better cricket.</p>,,2014-07-13
1145,<p>Home to Aylesbury who had beaten us by one run at the start of the season returned to meet a much younger side## with David and Steve pushing the average age only just into the high teens. Many of the boys have been with the club since they were single digits and as we were to see had been through the BWCC system being coached by Nigel## Bill## Roger and the team.</p> <p>Ben in charge whilst Paul was away in Scotland calculating the odds on 13.10 donkey derby at Gallowshields. Ben decided we would bat first and with a target in his mind of 200 we set off on the challenged.</p> <p>Sadly the third most senior player Basty was caught from his second edge to the keeper## then David steadied the ship with Matt O## David playing like an old pro and Matt looking as though he was going to get a quick fifty## but Aylesbury were good in the field and their opening bowlers had other plans for us with Matt and David both being caught on 23 and 28## Ben and Toby then came in and really pushed the run rate on from 3 to 5 ## the skipper bowled for 36 and Toby caught on 42## Steve did some backing up and then walked off again victim to an LBW## James followed shortly afterwards on 4 but Freddie and Will continued to pile on the runs Freddie not out on 25 and Will on 11. A defendable score of 189</p> <p>With guidance from the Umpire who really needed to get away by 18.30 to watch a re run celebrity masterplumber we took to the field with a strong bowling line up## so Ben put on the gloves to control matters from behind the stumps.</p> <p>I had the pleasure of being at first slip to watch our bowlers excel in their art with Will and Finn opening and the wickets just kept coming with the first scalp in the 3rd over to Will## then number two to Finn in the 4th and then two more to Finn in the 10th over## they were on 36 for 4. Ben then brought on Harry Livingstone who bowled as well as the openers also swinging the ball and giving almost no runs away and with Freddie at the other end bowling some unplayable leg spin Aylesburys troubles just continued with Harry and Freddie taking wickets in overs 14##15 and two in 16## so Aylesbury are now on 66 for 8 from 16 overs## The 20th over saw basty take out one of their former openers and then the last wicket was picked off by Freddie and the were all out for 71 from 22 overs.</p> <p>As one of the older two in the side i was so proud of the way the side batted bowled and fielded giving almost nothing away to a decent Aylesbury side ## a great win for Ben and the team.

1267,<p>Our penultimate U10B fixture and a struggle to put a side out due to cub camps## holidays and various school discos [if they are still called that].</p> <p>I was using up my U10A player allowance so we had a good cross section of players including Toby from U9 and Max Hayes from the U8 squad.</p> <p>With Thomas Berens in charge we took to the field to bowl## the manager Glynnis was scoring and directing from the club house with no tannoy required and a trainee umpire joined me to facilitate proceedings##from the fist over i was beginning to worry as the Winchmore boys and girls froze in front of the stumps ## most of them asking for middle and then placing their feet firmly on the mark## but that didnt really help much as the wickets kept coming for Oliver ## Max Hayes## two in a maiden for Matthew [great catch by Tom]## three in another maiden for Oliver ## one for Tom then Toby and another for Max Hayes## maiden overs all over the place## our only minor error was a dropped high catch by Toby at extra cover which he collected and threw to the keepers end and ran their player out## what great skill. Thomas bowled Max Hayes for 3 overs which was a great reflection on how well he had bowled &nbsp;his previous two overs. They finished their innings on 177. They had only scored 10 runs from the bat.</p> <p>Glynnis told me that her side were still learning and that we were too good ## i wasn't quite sure how to respond and in hindsight we should have fielded an U9 side if they had been available.&nbsp;</p> <p>In to bat we went## I told the other umpire that i would be very lenient on the calling of wides and no balls.

1234,<p>having won the toss and deciding to field Knotty Green were 12 off 2 and it looked like it was going to be a long evening.

1275,<p>Ballinger won by 7 wickets. &nbsp;Ballinger won the toss and put Aylesbury into bat## and immediately the Ballinger openers## Will Reid (4 overs## 1 for 10) and Will Arnold## were too good for them. &nbsp;Likewise Freddie Thompson's legspin (3 overs 1 for 5). &nbsp;Captain Ben Dugdale then used a range of bowlers to get everyone into the gane## fearing a low Aylesbury score## with mixed results. Aylesbury closed on 104 for 3 off their 20 overs. &nbsp;That total never presented too much of a challenge## with Ballinger up with or close to the rate for the first 8 overs## and then accelerating slightly to finish it off in 16 overs. &nbsp;Max Dugdale and Dom Brown started well until Dom lashed at one and spooned to mid on. &nbsp;Matt O'Kelly was bowled by a good one just as he was getting going. But then Max was joined by Ben## who with 33* saw his team home## even after Max's departure for 33## ably assisted then by Toby Lyons## who played some aggressive but classical cricket shots for his 21*. &nbsp;A well-paced chase and an easy win. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,2014-07-19
1164,<p>Ballinger's first ever visit to Bourne End for a league match was viewed with some trepidation## given the two clubs' relative positions in the league table## but with a strong team available we at least should surely do better than the hammering we received from them earlier in the season.&nbsp; The pitch had been covered to protect it from the recent downpours## so when the home side opted to bat first## it might be assumed that the pitch would be a good one. In fact## a completely wrong assumption## as from the very first delivery Will Reid and Nick Adams had the ball flying viciously at and over the batsmen's heads. Presumably Bourne End were used to dealing with this## as they tended either to&nbsp;hit and miss## or flay the ball to the boundary. Three wickets were down for 49 by the 14th&nbsp;over## with&nbsp; Nick keeping the lid on things with a good 10 over spell## taking 3 for 20. First change Evan Webster came in for some harsh punishment## but then Ian Maciver came on to bowl and he and Andy Thompson grabbed 3 quick wickets## so that Bourne End were 83 for 6 in the 25th over## and a manageable target looked in prospect. Unfortunately## it appeared that Bourne End tail## following the trend in the current Test series## batted rather better than their predecessors. Another wicket fell on 116 (31 overs)## but the total then raced to 159 before the final wicket was secured in the 39th over.</p> <p>With their two first choice openers available## Ballinger needed a good opening partnership to set them on their way. Just like England. And just like for England## it didn't happen. Richard O'Kelly went first## victim of a fine diving slip catch. Rollo fenced&nbsp; at yet another sharply rising ball## and went for 0. 23 for 2&nbsp; soon became 44 for 5## as Matt (for a patient 12 in 50 balls)## Monty Thompson and Will Smith departed. The rot looked terminal## but Max Dugdale had obviously taken note of Bourne End's batting technique on such a wicket## and produced a superlative display of stroke-making## while Andy Thomson&nbsp;dug in at&nbsp;the other end. Their stand was worth 36 when Andy fell. caught and bowled. Max then hoisted a huge hit into the deep and was unlucky to select a fielder who could actually catch## out for a stimulating 43. The Ballinger tail then bucked the current trend## and subsided limply## but not before gathering a second batting point## which might come in handy## looking at their league position.</p> <p>Ballinger were indebted to Jamie Kellock for standing in as umpire.

1146,<p>After a lot of shilly shallying which resulted in the loss of 4 overs per side the game finally got underway around 2pm but the skipper lost what might have proved to be a decisive toss and we were inserted on a still drying wicket. Our regular opening pair &nbsp;of Stuart and Matt got the innings off to a very solid start notching 64 at 4 an over before Stuart departed for 46## once again dodging the traditional jug buying ceremony. Despite losing three quick wickets (or not quick enough in the case of Basty's run out !) Ben and Dom took up the cudgels and battered the Bourne End attack## recording their 18th (or was that pub talk ?) 50 run partnership together this season. When they both perished in the cause of quick runs## Freddie T ##Will and Fin scampered some very useful runs including several byes to their increasinglly frustrated wicket keeper. A score of 171 looked likely to be enough so we all enjoyed an excellent tea provided by Fiona.</p> <p>A good start was needed and Fin and Will duly provided one reducing the opposition to 17 for 3 after 10 overs. Job done surely ? However in the long established tradition of Bourne End they were going to go down swinging and everyone gets lucky once in a while. 63 runs were added in the next 5 overs despite the loss of 2 more wickets and by drinks they were exactly half way to their target with half the innings gone. With the two Freddies operating in tandem and Dom now behind the stumps## to the disappointment of messrs Rashid and Haseeb## a measure of control was restored although several crucial catches were dropped. This enabled them to keep the required rate just below a run a ball and with most overs containing a 'four ball' the total nudged up. A good catch from Stuart in the penultimate over left the final pair needing 6 from the final over. A loose first delivery and yet another dropped chance ensured we snatched defeat from the jaws of victory !</p> <p>A good game played in a great spirit and one we never really looked like losing until it finished.

The pair not only re-build but extend and put on 105 runs in the next 13 overs and take the score to 126 before Hamish is caught looking for another big hit## the score now a respectable 126 for 5 off 18 overs. Max continuing to punish the Wendover bowlers who must have regretted several dropped catches during his innings. Ballinger finishing on 149 for 7 with Max unbeaten on 79## a captains innings.</p> <p>Having posted a challenging total Ballinger looked to make things difficult for the opposition. Fin Clarke and Will Arnold opening the attack and giving nothing away. Sam Peters and Dom Brown picking up were they left off. Excellent bowling and scoreboard pressure adding to Wendovers woes with a couple of panicky run outs making a difficult situation impossible. Wickets fell at&nbsp;regular intervals and Wendover collapsed to 40 all out off 12 overs. Sam Peters the pick of the bowlers with 5 for 9 off 2.2 overs..</p> <p>Max's batting and Sam's bowling the highlights of the morning but congratulations to all the team for a great win.

1182,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">This week the Sunday XI ventured north of Aylesbury to the small but picturesque village of Cublington. Losing the toss and fielding on a large ground with an excellent wicket and a lack of bowlers could have been a recipe for disaster. However we stuck at the task well and managed to restrict Cublington to a score of 208 for 6 from their 40 overs. The wickets were shared between three bowlers each with two wickets; James Mcintrye## Rob Farquar and Basty who has the happy knack of picking up important wickets## crucially dismissing the dangerous Carter for 42. Credit must also go to the part time bowlers Marcus and Tom who managed to restrict the Cublington run rate even towards the backend of their innings.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">After an excellent tea and a spot of drizzle Ballinger opened up confidently with the father and son pairing of Rob and Tom Mcintrye. However despite a good start both openers managed to find novel ways of getting out## Tom chipped a ball which had bounced three times straight to cover and Rob got into a mix up with Danny over calling an easy single. Danny and I then attempted to get the run chase back on track by being watchful but still looking to pick up singles and punish the bad deliveries. We were able to put on a partnership of 88 and at 120-2 with 16 overs left## Ballinger fancied their chances of pulling off an unlikely victory. However both Danny and I were out in consecutive overs triggering a lower-middle order collapse. With the loss of wickets## our run rate stalled and despite Max Dugdales explosive striking and excellent batting he couldn&rsquo;t haul the team over the line by himself. In the end Cublington&rsquo;s score of 208 was 20 runs above par and to have won the game we needed one of the top 5 batsmen to go on and score 70+ rather than 3 of us scoring 40.</p> <p>&nbsp;Nevertheless it was an enjoyable game played in good spirit against friendly but skilled opposition. We look forward to hosting Cublington in September when we can hopefully have a few more frontline bowlers in the side.&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">For technical reasons Rob Farquhar appears as James Fray on the scorecard</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Will Smith</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>",,2014-07-22
1201,<p>With 13 players unavailable and 6 changes to Sunday's side a new look Ballinger took on Chenies &amp; Latimer in the final league game of the season. Captain Ben Dugdale won the toss again## 5 out of 6 for the season## and opted to bat. Max and Matt got off to a good start and put on 22 for the first wicket in the fourth over. Matt'a departure brought&nbsp;Kenny to the crease for an outing at 3 after much negociating throughout the season. Max telling Kenny to take his time obviously had no effect## with Kenny holing out to mid on after 4 deliveries. Ben joined Max in the middle and they put on 50 runs before Max mistimed one to mid off## Ballinger 88 for 3 off 11 overs## a very healthy run rate. Hamish in next and he and Ben take the score to 110 before Ben is bowled by a ball that kept very low. Marcus Tingey## making his u17 debut## having a brief spell at the crease## Ballinger 112 for 5 off 15 overs. Will Arnold now joining Hamish and the pair adding a further 39 runs in the last 5 overs## with Hamish doing most of the damage## finishing on 39 not out## Ballinger 151 for 5.</p> <p>Having set a challinging total the captain decided to mix up his bowling options with various degrees of success. Rob Farquhar## flown in from Hungary for this game got Ballinger off to a good start with a wicket in his first over. C &amp; L added 38 runs before losing their second wicket## Will Arnold doing the damage. It was Will again 3 runs later## C &amp; L 45 for 3 off 8 overs and again 2 runs later## 47 for 4 off 10. Max Dugdale now on and bowling some interesting variation## gave C &amp; L some restbite and they managed to push the score&nbsp; to 72 before Hamish claimed a further 2 wickets in his third over with a variation of leg spin## off spin and no spin. C &amp; L 72 for 7 off 13. Further bowling changes allowed C &amp; L to take the score to 125 for 7 after 19 overs## 26 runs needed in the final over to win. Hamish on for the last over## reverting back to his usual action and taking the final 3 wickets only conceding a bye## C &amp; L all out for 126. Hamish finishing with 6 for 8 off his 4 overs.</p> <p>Ballinger securing the league with 6 wins out of 6. A squad of 24 players from u17 to u14 used throughout the season## all playing their part in some excellent cricket. 834 runs scored with the loss of 32 wickets conceding 548 runs and taking 46 wickets. Very impressive and things looking good for the future of Ballinger cricket.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Miles Dugdale</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-07-23

1147,<p>Taking a strong side to Cadmore is not always a guarantee of success however they have made great strides with their wicket - although the outfield remains interesting ! With the skipper held up behind the corporation dustcart## stand in Stuart called tails to the chagrin of his teammates and BWCC duly took to the field in blistering heat. The only problem for the newly arrived Branners was how to deploy his pack of hungry bowlers. The ball was thrown to Evan##who had wisely ducked the Ballinger road that Jamie had prepared in order to get some first team runs. He and usual opener Fin were miserly conceding just 17 runs between them off their opening spells. 'Pads' was however getting redder in the face as he familiarised himself with the unique Cadmore slopes. Drinks at 13 overs and no wickets down## time for Harry and Tom to have a crack. By the time drinks were taken again at 26 overs## Cadmore were 74-6## the wickets shared between them plus a fantastic run out from Stuart with the Dude (now behind the stumps) finishing the job off. In trying to repeat the feat a few overs later a now highly excitable Dude beat Stuart's accurate throw to the stumps ! Another short spell of magic from Freddie confused the remaining batsmen and our opening pair were recalled to mop up the by now bemused Cadmore tail##a fine slip catch from Pads being the highlight - he really doesn't need those gloves !</p> <p>Our regular openers took to the field after an early tea and by drinks at 13 overs the game was all but over. Stuart## determined not to have to bat for too long## finally got the 50 he'd been avoiding all season ably supported by Matt. By 5pm hands were being shaken and the pub was the next objective.</p> <p>Thanks to Dick for helping us out this week and Max Conway for resuming the pencil duties.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-07-27
1165,"<p>Unsuccessful at the toss## Ballinger's under-strength bowling line up had to endure the hottest Saturday of the summer## facing the usually high scoring Downley## on a pitch perfecly made for batting. So when Nick Adams accounted for both openers## one of them superbly caught by a flying Danny Draper## and only 30 on the board in the seventh over## hopes were high. However## the next wicket was not to fall until 97## and by this time Downley's number three R Ali## after a watchful start##&nbsp;was giving&nbsp;a superlative batting exhibition## excelling at the late cut## and with R Ullah (42) put on 105 for the 4th wicket## by which time the total was 205## and still 4 overs left for the hapless bowlers to suffer. Ali was bowled by persevering skipper Ian Davies for a magnificent 105## whereupon J Cox proceded to flog 25 off a mere 12 deliveries## to set Ballinger a mountainous target of 256 - their previous best this season being 179 -4!</p> <p>With a good batting track and a strong batting side## there was every hope that at last we might see their full potential unleashed.&nbsp; Attack was to be the order of the day## and Danny Draper## making his debut in the league side this season smashed a couple of fours off the first over - then promptly was dismissed LBW by umpire Dugdale## rapidly followed by Andy Thompson getting a top edge to fine leg off his first aggressive shot. 10 for 2 by the 4th over was not in line with team orders## but Rollo McIntyre and Ian Davies got their heads down well and rebuilt the innings so effectively that having reached a half century partnership## it was a surprise when Ian was bowled by an excellent delivery## having made 23. Richard O'Kelly kept the board moving with a quick 18## but was then caught by the keeper## as was Rollo who by this time was scoring freely## and the Ballinger run rate well ahead of Downley's. It accelerated even further with the advent of Will Smith at the crease## as he smashed two mighty sixes## before sallying fatally down the pitch## wafting at thin air## and be being stumped by a mile.This was a real waste of an opportunity## as he and Max Dugdale had been making batting look easy## and they had ample time in which to set up victory. Max## who after a tentative start## was increasing in confidence with every ball## also struck two sixes in a fine 31## before he too perished LBW. That made it 159 for 7## with 10 overs left. At the 30 over mark## Downley had been 149 but the difference was that they had only lost 3 wickets. Monty Thompson came in to bat sensibly## taking any runs available## and finishing unbeaten on 29##&nbsp;but there was no-one left to keep the requisite momentum up## and the innings ambled along to finish on 194 for 9## when the overs ran out.</p> <p>By no means a demoralising defeat## and perhaps with some of our missing bowlers available the target might have been lower.&nbsp; Perhaps## but all the bowlers did as well as could be expected## and Richard O'Kelly might have cut down on the byes had he been fully fit.

1183,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Winning the toss and batting on a beautiful day## flat track## lighting quick outfield and a strong batting line-up Ballinger were expecting a total of at least 240. However the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry## and none of the top 5 batsmen showed any application and Ballinger were struggling at 110-8 in the 25<sup>th</sup> over with only Reece Tiley batting properly for a stylish 41. It was now left down to Will Arnold and David Livingstone (on debut) to see if they could at least make Ballinger&rsquo;s score respectable. They proceed to play &lsquo;clever cricket&rsquo; by running very quick singles## and being watchful and circumspect to balls outside the off stump while thrashing anything short and wide to the boundary. In short they showed skill and application far above their positions in the batting order. &nbsp;Gradually Ballinger&rsquo;s score began to creep up## thanks to an excellent 48 not out by Will ably supported by David. We ended up on 197 from our 40 overs which was 50 more runs than we could have hoped for at 110-8 but ultimately 20 runs below par on such a quick outfield.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">After a first-rate tea and quick warm up Ballinger went out into the field confident in a strong bowling attack and youthful fielding side. The opening pair of Will Arnold and Harry Livingstone both adroitly managed to control a swinging ball with devastating effect taking 3 wickets in the first few overs. Rob Farquhar came on first change and managed to maintain the pressure by bowling accurately and keeping the run rate down. However despite this promising start the Chearsley Captain## Ricketts## was beginning to find the boundary regularly and he was well supported by their number 6 batsman who was adept at finding the gaps and rotating the strike. These two played incredibly well and their 140 run partnership won the game for Chearsley## in particular credit to Ricketts who was very unlucky to finish on 97 not out.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Despite losing a close match it was nevertheless an enjoyable day playing on a nice ground with great weather against friendly opposition.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;""><span style=""text-indent: 36pt;"">Will Smith</span></p>",,2014-07-27
1185,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Having had both Saturdays matches rained off it was a relief to arrive at Amersham with clear blue skies## and an even bigger relief to lose the toss and be asked to bat on a small ground with a very quick outfield! Openers Matt R (39) and Matt O&rsquo;Kelly (24) started brightly## both capitalizing on anything back of a length and in particular playing the late cut (or outside edge?) through gully/third man with great skill.&nbsp; Despite the excellent start and 50 partnership both openers managed to get themselves out to short and wide deliveries## Riley by giving catching practise to cover and Matt edging one behind to the keeper. I carried on my season long habit or getting in and then getting out cheaply by spooning a catch to midwicket. By now Max was beginning to look more assured at the crease despite a streaky start and was well accompanied by Toby (21) and Ben (28) whom he shared consecutive 50 partnerships with. Unfortunately Max was run out going in an effort to retain the strike and get to 99. Nevertheless Max played exceptionally well; he combines a bludgeoning and aggressive batting style with outstanding selectivity and normally very good running between the wickets. The tail failed to wag as it had in previous games and we actually ended up being bowled out in the final over. However we finished on an imposing total of 282 from our 40 overs## the only black mark against an otherwise excellent batting performance being 3 run outs!</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">It made a nice change for the Ballinger opening bowlers and skipper to have a lot of runs to play with and consequently we could bowl and have fields set to take wickets rather than limit runs. This suited Alex who bowled excellently to take 3 wickets for few runs in his first spell## he was backed up by Dom who was a little erratic but still managed to pick up a wicket. Stuart came on first change and bowled miserly; squeezing the Amersham batsman and causing the required run rate to rocket upwards of 10 an over. The scoreboard pressure proved too much for Amersham and Stuart claimed 4 wickets while Monty chipped in with two to wrap things up for Ballinger at 18:30 in the 25<sup>th</sup> over!</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">In short this was the best performance the Sunday XI have had this season and made skippering the side easy and enjoyable## hopefully a sign of things to come over the rest of the season!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Will Smith</strong></p>",,2014-08-04
1149,<p>Barn Meadow was the venue for this fixture## aptly named judging by the condition of the pitch. Captain Stuart Clark winning the toss and chosing to field## not knowing what the strip was likely to do. With a youthful bowling attack and an unpredictable strip Ballinger were soon in control. Fin Clark taking the first wicket in the third over## Dom Brown the second in the fourth## Dom again in the sixth followed by Fin in the seventh## Ley Hill 29 for 4 after some tight bowling## some loose shots and some good catches from Freddie DS## Tom Petrie and Toby Lyons. It was Dom again in the twelth over## keeper Ben Dugdale taking the catch. Andy Rowe and Freddie Thompson taking over from Fin and Dom. Freddie bowling great line and length and getting plenty of turn on an unhelpful pitch kept Ley Hill under pressure. Wickets continued to fall with Freddie the main danger## taking 5 wickets in his 5.3 overs## 2 bowled## 2 stumpings from Ben and a catch from&nbsp;Tom Petrie and only conceding 6 runs. A stunned Ley Hill all out for 60 with their captain commenting he thought they had a strong batting side.</p> <p>Ballinger took to the middle with Stuart Clark and Matt O'Kelly. Batting wasn't easy and Matt was first to go with the score on 13 in the third over. Even Stuart was struggling to get any rhythm and he was also deceived by a ball that stood up and could only glove it to the keeper. Ballinger 28 for 2 in the tenth over. Tom Petrie and Toby Lyons were now at the crease and both took their time to settle. Some tight bowling from Ley Hill made things difficult but the pair batted sensibly and took the score to 62 in the nineteenth over## Tom not out on 36## securing the win and the points for Ballinger.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-08-09
1167,<p>Time is fast running out for Ballinger if they are to stand any chance of avoiding relegation. On an ideal day for cricket ## with a pitch unaffected by overnight rain## thanks to our new cover## they produced another disappointing performance## allowing Ley Hill to avenge their defeat earlier in the season.</p> <p>Having won the toss## Ley Hill unsurprisingly opted to bat first## but initially things looked bright for the home team## when Alex Howe struck with the very first ball of his spell## courtesy of an athletic diving catch at gully by Will Smith. This was followed by Will Reid's successful LBW shout against the number 3 bat## Ford. That made it 20 for 2## with 7 overs gone## but thereafter it was all downhill as a lengthy partnership of 82 developed between opener J Lown and O Runswick. Both started cautiously## but they steadily mastered Ballinger's (mostly!) youthful attack## and when Runswick eventually fell to the persevering Carlton Siddle he had made 56## and the total had reached 103## in the 28th over. That meant that the bowlers now had to contend with the talented S Daluwatte. With Lown now scoring freely with shots his own team said they had never seen from him before## the score was rocketting along. Lown was at last bowled by Will Reid for a valuable 65## and Daluwatte raced on to 48 not out## as Ley Hill finished on 206 for 4.</p> <p>Any half-decent side would reckon on pursuing 207 on such a good wicket. Indeed Ballinger started as though they were well up to the task. Danny Draper and Andy Thompson set a cracking pace## aided it must be said by a flurry of extras## and had 43 on the board in 10 overs before Danny's patience got the better of him and was caught&nbsp;by the keeper&nbsp;for 9.Will Smith now joined Andy who was batting so well that he looked as if he might win the match single-handed. But having reached a fine 44## he top-edged a catch. 69 for 2 became 78 for 3 when Ian Davies' brief knock ended. The patient Will Smith and Carlton had seen the score to 103 when Carlton somehow found himself LBW## at which point the wheels well and truly fell off - a not uncommon Ballinger scenario. Two more wickets fell without addition to the total## and a further two at 127. Ballinger's only realistic hope was now to reach 158## at which point they could claim bonus points for scoring 75% of their opponents' total. Thanks to some adventurous running and hard hitting&nbsp; this target was reached (- just!)## a credit to those mainly involved - Will Arnold## Will Reid and Evan Webster whose towering 6 saw us reach the necessary score## whereupon the final wicket went down.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2014-08-10

1168,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">On a sticky wicket## overcast conditions and Ballinger being asked to bat this match had all the pre-requisite ingredients for another one of our many batting collapses this season. However this was not to be## as the batsman (bar myself) showed application## fortitude and skill we haven&rsquo;t really produced all season.&nbsp; Our innings was built around partnerships and contributions of 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s with no one going on to make a big score## but due to the nature of the pitch you were never really &lsquo;in&rsquo;. Andy was probably the pick of the batsmen with a well crafted 39## playing the hook and pull shot with great aplomb## however he was unluckily given out LBW despite suggestions of an inside edge.

1169,<p>Ballinger went in to this must-win fixture shorn of the greater part of their first eleven squad## so a casual spectator (if we have any) would be forgiven for thinking he had turned up to watch the high flying Seconds in action. Wendover won the toss## and possibly because they knew that they were certainties for relegation## decided to bat first. With 20 on the board after only 3 overs## they must have been confident that it was to be their day. Although Nick Adams went wicketless in his first spell## Will Arnold was bowling particularly well## and struck in his third over to make it 24 for 1. A stubborn stand then ensued## but the scoring rate steadily diminished## and the next wicket went to an on-song Evan Webster with the total on 60## and he quickly followed with two more victims.&nbsp; Ian Maciver tied up the batsmen at the other end## then clean bowled Wendover's best batsman## the left handed N Morley for 37. Nick## scenting cheap wickets in a second spell## duly delivered##with two in his first over in consecutive deliveries. His hat-trick ball was## alas## a high full toss.... The Wendover innings was by now in ruins. A superb throw by Matt O'Kelly (thereby fully redeeming a dropped dolly!) saw his father complete a valuable run-out## and Will Arnold wrapped up the tail end with two more scalps## finishing a fine performance with 3 for 14. Ballinger's few oldies were given a lesson in fielding by the youngsters whose efforts were first class.</p> <p>With a target of only 97## would Ballinger's batsmen be up to the task? The answer was a resounding yes! Openers Richard O'Kelly and James McIntyre never looked to be in any trouble as they kept the scoreboard ticking steadily## concentrating on punishing any loose bowling## but avoiding any unneccessary risks. Repeated bowling changes by Wendover were unavailing## and it was only when the target was in sight that they both lost a little concentration and were caught. James went first## having made a stylish 28##with some sumptuous stroke play## and Richard followed soon after having reached&nbsp;a match winning 50. Their partnership of 81 was by some way Ballinger's best of the season. An 8 wicket victory left a number of batsmen frustrated in the pavilion## but the batting display in this match## coupled with the all round solidity in last week's performance showed clearly why the team have been flirting for so long with relegation - their inconsistent batsmen have simply been letting them down.</p>,,2014-08-23
1152,<p>The final game of the season was upon us## and the Seconds had only tasted defeat once since a wet Saturday in early June over at Waddesdon. Up against Widmer End IIs who were languishing in the bottom half of the league## the skipper had already decided to have a bat when on losing the toss -again - we were inserted by the oppo. A solid start from the regular opening pair Stuart and Matt saw the score into the 30s before Matt departed and James Mac joined Stu in what was to prove the key partnership of the match. By the time Stuart was caught out at Cow## for 66 the score had passed a hundred off 22 overs. Ben joined James and looked to push the score along as the lads occasionally looked for a quick single or two. With a plethora of talent still in the hutch Ben fell to the wily Hobbs and was soon joined by the skipper who failed to make his first visit to the crease for a couple of months a lengthy one ! Andy ##back from Oz## had also not wielded a bat in anger for a considerable time but made better use of the opportunity and pushed the run rate up. By now James had reached his fifty and was also beginning to accelerate## finally reaching 81 when the innings closed - the highest score in the league by any Ballinger batsman this season.</p> <p>Widmer started badly with Fin's box of allsorts claiming 3 wickets whilst Tom's more orthodox approach at the other end went unrewarded. A switch to spin brought more wickets as both Ben and Freddie made further inroads into the opposition batting. By the time Matt came on to clean up what was left## the only thing on both teams minds was to get to the Swan as fast as possible.</p> <p>Another overwhelming win for the 2s rounded up the season nicely and we must just wait to see if it will be enough for the team to get promoted and face some new opposition next season.</p> <p>Thanks to all who played this year and to in particular to Nigel and Stuart who skippered in my absence (and often in my presence !) and to Miles for all those umpiring points as well as all those who conjured up teas for us all.</p> <p></p>,,2014-08-31
1170,<p>Safe at last from relegation worries## Ballinger's visit to the picturesque surroundings at Bradenham gave them an opportunity to go one better## and climb to mid-table respectability. A chance they took with a vengeance## as Bradenham## opting to bat first## found themselves utterly webstered. This new cricketing term refers to the devastating swing bowling produced by Evan Webster## who if his first over goes well## can well prove unplayable. The total stood at 39 for&nbsp;2 when he came on to bowl## the early breakthroughs caused by a successful LBW shout&nbsp;from Nick Adams## and a suicidal second run attempt which alert fielding capitalised on. Enter Evan. His fourth ball went for a boundary## the next was exit the batsman## bowled. Only&nbsp;two singles were conceded&nbsp;by him for the rest of the innings## during which he claimed another 5&nbsp;hapless victims## remarkably all of them&nbsp;clean bowled## or inside edged. Meanwhile Will Arnold claimed the wicket of the dogged opener Hoddle##&nbsp;without whose 31 runs Bradenham would have been facing utter disaster. Monty Thompson chipped in to spoil&nbsp;Evan's chances of entering Ballinger bowling history## and when Evan took the final wicket## his figures read&nbsp;6.4 overs - 3 maidens - 6 wickets for 6 runs&nbsp;! A superb performance.</p> <p>With the&nbsp;clock standing at only ten past three## Ballinger's batsmen went out to see whether they could finish the job before tea.&nbsp;Well## most of them. Matt Riley## having&nbsp;despatched the fourth ball of the innings to the boundary## then realised that this was truly unseemly&nbsp;aggression on his part## and settled down to his proper role## nicking singles off the last ball of an over whenever possible. No such inhibitions affected Richard O'Kelly (20) and Rollo McIntyre (17)## but in a match where remarkably not a single catch was taken## both departed ## bowled. Tea was deferred## and Matt and Danny Draper saw Ballinger steadily home## with Matt suddenly casting off the shackles## and hoisting the winning runs with a six!</p> <p>Game over at half past four## time for a pleasant tea with pleasant opposition## then off to Ballinger to watch the Seconds triumph in their match.&nbsp; A truly enjoyable way to end the season.</p>,,2014-09-01
1190,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">It is always a huge pleasure to play cricket at Long Marston. It is fantastic ground with an excellent wicket## at which minor county games are played.&nbsp; Ballinger elected to bat first &ndash; you can&rsquo;t sensibly do anything else on a &ldquo;road&rdquo; like that. &nbsp;Opener Basty Richards fell early## but then his partner## Matt O&rsquo;Kelly## and Nick Tegg built up a steady partnership. &nbsp;The run rate was however getting a little pedestrian and so Nick rightly tried to push it on## but perished in the process. The stage was set perfectly for Rollo McIntyre## who came in and## as ever## moved the scoring along with some big and sweetly timed shots## before he was eventually out for 71.&nbsp; After Matt fell for a very diligent 37 off 31 overs## the scoring was taken on by Will Smith## Rob McIntyre (56*) and at the end Andy Thompson (33*)## with Ballinger 259 for 6 declared off 46 overs -&nbsp; about 200 of those scored off the last 26.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">One had the feeling that even a target of 260 might not be enough on a very good pitch and fast outfield## and so it proved.&nbsp; Ballinger kept the old ball (we were playing with 2 new balls) and opened with Freddie Thompson and James McIntyre both bowling leg breaks. The game might have been very different if Freddie (or the skipper) had answered Rollo&rsquo;s question of &ldquo;do you want me first or second slip?&rdquo; differently. Rollo ended up at second and Freddie&rsquo;s first ball was edged through first. The Long Marston opener went on to blast 101 retired off 18 overs## by which point Long Marston effectively had it in the bag.&nbsp; After 5 overs of spin## Ballinger had reverted to the new ball and the more regular opening seam attack of Nick Adams and Alex Howe.&nbsp; Nick in particular bowled his usual tight lines and came away with the creditable figures of 1 for 65 off 13. Freddie came back to bowl another spell and ended with 2 for 65 off 10.&nbsp; But it was all really a matter of just trying to delay the inevitable and attain respectability. &nbsp;To Ballinger&rsquo;s credit## we did do that## slowing the scoring## taking some wickets and remaining committed and effective in the field. &nbsp;The reality is that on that track we needed 300 off 45 overs and then a bit of luck!&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>",,2014-09-07
1191,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Batting first by agreement## Ballinger initially seemed to be facing really quite an impressive opening attack for a Sunday## with Matt Riley and Jamie Kellock dismissed relatively early## followed a little later by Danny Draper (after a battling 22## including a 6 which nearly took out one of the pavilion windows) and Kenny Holt## before the Jordans Taverners opening bowlers had finished their work. However## Will Smith## coming in at number 4## having seen off the last of the openers## then plundered a really excellent 119 against the remaining bowlers## batting with skill## confidence and## latterly## audacity - a truly excellent innings## peppered with sixes and improvisation.&nbsp; Will was ably supported by some lusty blows from Steve Conway and Steve Carter and then## after Will was finally out## from David Livingstone in the last few overs## before## in his capacity as skipper## Will declared at 230 for 6 after only 41 overs## having used considerably less than half of the likely available time - a confident declaration to match the confidence of his innings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">It also proved a well-judged declaration## as Jordans never really looked as if they were genuinely trying to overhaul Ballinger&rsquo;s total and in the end only just hung on## with 9 wickets down## after 47 overs.&nbsp; The declaration was also## in one sense## bold## since even at the outset Ballinger were a little short of bowlers## with Nick Adams## Andy Thompson and Matt O&rsquo;Kelly## to be supplemented by David Livingstone having his first bowl of the season. Unfortunately## after only 5 overs## David damaged his knee diving in the covers## restricting the bowling attack even further. &nbsp;Luckily the two old warhorses## Adams and Thompson## bowled 17 and 18 overs respectively and Matt O&rsquo;Kelly turned in an accurate and penetrating spell## picking up 1 for 23.&nbsp; But the bowling highlight and provider of the champagne moment was Matt Riley&rsquo;s occasional off spin## which claimed a wicket with his very first ball## as a long hop loosener was slapped conveniently to mid-off.&nbsp; Matt then bought another wicket## but his purchasing power then expired as the Jordans number 9## Murphy## tucked into some juicy full tosses## whacking them over the fielders at long on and cow corner for a series of sixes## to produce the only moment in the game when Jordans looked as if they might just go for a win. &nbsp;Thankfully Thompson was brought back and bowled Murphy## leaving the final pair to hang on for the last few overs and secure a draw.&nbsp; A very good Ballinger performance. &nbsp;The other contenders for champagne moment were Kenny Holt&rsquo;s 2 calmly taken catches at mid-on&nbsp; &hellip;. &nbsp;Kenny seemed as pleased and surprised as everyone else!</p>",,2014-09-17
1421,<p>The fixture computer served up a tough opening game in a higher division for the 2s. Early season absences compunded the problems with none of our top ten bowlers and only one of our top ten batsmen from last year's averages available. To then run up against Salid Ali whose predeliction for despatching any good length balls way over the boundary was## to say the least## unfortunate. After the first six overs went for 63 runs we were in deep trouble. A change of pace with debutant Graham Jones replacing Will brought a little respite and when Andy finally bowled Ali off his pads the pain started to ease. A tremendous piece of fielding from Matt (finished of by Pads Conway) saw the other ambling opener on his way back to the hutch. Andy & Graham and some decent fielding had gradually swung the game back towards us## to such an extent that Lacey Green were reduced to 101-7. However## we became increasingly frustrated as a partnership between another big hitter and a youngster added 82 runs despite some tight bowling from Matt. He eventually got the breakthrough and wrapped up the innings with an excellent c&b## rounding off a top fielding display. New boys Philip## Harry & Charlie saved at least 20 runs in the field## keeping up the traditional top notch fielding from Ballinger's youngsters.</p> <p>After an excellent tea provided by Lizzy we needed a decent start but unfortunately Matt fell c&b and was quickly followed by Will. At the other end Ben looked very comfortable after a 4 year absence and was accumulating runs at a good rate. He was backed up by Charlie who looked very much at home in senior cricket. The running between the wickets was excellent but proved Ben's downfall when a momentary hesitation left him inches short. The opposition then summoned one man demolition merchant Ali into the attack who## in an accurate spell of bowling## claimed a couple of quick wickets - Charlie & Andy## whilst Harry & Phil perished at the other end. At 58-7 and only four old men left## 26 overs seemed a lot of time to fill ! The skipper dropped anchor whilst Peter (a last minute replacement) kept the score ticking over - despite being in pain every time he hit the ball. The skipper went with the score in the nineties and Graham followed shortly after## once again Ali doing the damage. Pads - well rested after his exertions behind the stumps joined Peter with 15 overs still left and they started to worry the oppo as the score passed 100 then 125 and the run rate started to pick up. However one risk too many from Steve finally saw the gallant effort fall short.</p> <p>Many thanks to Dave Carlin who stepped in to umpire## securing the Seconds first points of the new season## to Max for scoring and for Peter for stepping in at the last minute. A game played in a decent spirit and a respectable## if disappointing. start to the new season.</p> <p></p> <p>Paul Branigan</p> <p></p> <p></p>,,2015-05-03
1283,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Monks Risborough - so often the graveyard Ballinger hopes.&nbsp; In recent memory our record away at Monks Risborough has been woeful.&nbsp; Sadly## that pattern continued as the Ballinger 1<sup>st</sup> XI played its first league match this season on a cold Spring Chiltern hillside.&nbsp; In fact## it may be unusual local conditions created by the severe slopes and the always slightly underprepared wickets which contribute to this poor record.&nbsp; However## Ballinger&rsquo;s problems this time were largely created in our own heads and by some excellent Monks Risborough bowling.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ballinger&rsquo;s bowling and fielding was actually pretty impressive for a first outing## perhaps reflecting the good attendance at winter training and at the first outdoor session on Friday. &nbsp;Openers## Nick Adams and Will Reid dropped right onto a good line and length and were rewarded with 4 for 28 and 1 for 13 respectively.&nbsp; New skipper## Ian Maciver## turned to Rollo McIntyre as first change to replace Will## and Rollo showed a Botham-esque ability to take wickets with balls that could not fairly be described as wicket taking deliveries## ending up with 4 for 33 off 5 overs.&nbsp; When Carlton Siddle took the last wicket with his first ball## Ballinger were pretty pleased with having dismissed the home side for only 84 off 20.1 overs.&nbsp; But for a series of huge blows from number 8 K Ahmed## finishing with 32 not out## the score could have been a lot lower; particularly as he was dropped on nought. Luckily the offending fieldsman was also the bowler## otherwise the bowler might have got his hair drier out.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Chasing that low total## Ballinger started well enough## but after Richard O&rsquo;Kelly was run out## it was downhill all the way. &nbsp;The opening bowlers were seen off## but it was the first and second change bowlers who did all the damage## taking 3 for 19 and## amazingly## 5 for 0 off six overs## with another run out (Rollo) contributing to the collapse to 40 all out.&nbsp; The pitch was not great## but it was fear of the pitch rather than the pitch itself which did the damage.&nbsp; Only Ian Davies## who got a shooter## could blame the pitch itself.&nbsp; There are both technical and mental lessons to be learned.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The best that can be said about this performance with the bat is perhaps that we have got it out of the way early in the season## and on one of the rare occasions when our President and scorer## Gerry Hunting## was not there to witness the debacle.&nbsp; One feels that Gerry would not have been amused.</p>",,2015-05-03

1284,<p>Forecasters have made a bit of a mess of things lately## so after last week's abysmal batting show anyone predicting Ballinger's highest total since July 2013 would have got very good odds.</p> <p>The ground looked a picture - well done Jamie## and all those who helped at last month's working party.

Target number one was to beat last week's all out 40## and this was achieved in the 13th over. Regular Bradenham bowling changes had no success## and the century partnership looked a certainty until Richard miscued## out for a very attractive 56. Rollo was next in## and## misreading the pitch## was lucky to profit from an easy dropped catch. Hitherto the Bradenham fielding had looked very sharp## so this was an unexpected bonus## from which Rollo took full advantage. Cars and buildings around the ground now started to suffer## as he opted for the aerial route.

There were some star performances in the field - two swift stumpings by Richard## a great effort by Will Reid managing not to topple over the boundary as he clung onto a skyer## and an Adams special##his arm at full stretch## the ball appearing in his hand as all looked towards the boundary.

Wendover won the toss and put us in to bat on this clear but chilly evening## clearly they hadn&rsquo;t been told about the Ballinger setting sun. Our skipper Toby clearly had a plan and opened up with Matthew W and Charlie W and what a great start with both boys placing the ball well for singles and two&rsquo;s and running extras when the opportunity presented itself## they took the team up to 221 without loss. James Garner faced some accurate bowling along with Harry and both boys picked up singles and James G found the boundary ## the first of the match## sadly losing one wicket in their pair they however returned to the pavilion after having pushed the total up to a very respectable 233. James Batchelor and Jack dominated in the middle with eight singles and Jack twice finding the boundary## really putting the pressure on the visitors they strode off leaving the team on 255 from 12 overs## Tom and Josh faced two of the better bowlers and played very well and didn&rsquo;t lose their wickets and they pushed the score further upwards to 260 from 16 overs## a good score from the side## however Freddie and Toby had decided to really put the pressure on and with Freddie hard to take off strike and with every possible extra being run Freddie hit six fours from the spell and the skipper Toby stealing singles and extras on an industrial scale## both boys backing each other up like true professionals. The pair scored 56 from their four overs with only one small error which allowed Wendover to take their second wicket## back to the pavillion with the team on 310 for 2 ## a commanding score.</span></p> <div style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"">Both teams ran in for cakes and drinks very kindly organised by Jessica Ward [a huge thank you] and BWCC took to the field.

Wendover finished on 259 for 7 ## Ballinger never looked like they were out of the driving seat from the first ball that was bowled## with solid fielding ## strong and sensible batting and tight bowling.

Having won the toss## the skipper spotted that the unathletic looking Wendover side had only 10 men and cruelly prescribed 150 minutes in the heat of the day for them. Stu## making his seasonal bow## took full advantage## despite some tight bowling from the opening attack. The early loss of Ben no1## bought Ben no 2 to the wicket## who curbed his attacking instincts## dropping anchor and taking 20 balls to get off the mark. He eventually perished for 31 of an 85 run partnership. A clatter of wickets reduced BWCC to 140 for 5 but Stu still unbeaten on 85## with 10 overs left. He and the skipper added 67 from the next 9 overs before a clearly inebriated Clark mistook Paul for Usain Bolt and ran him out for a useful 31. Clearly contrite he rounded off his and Ballinger's innings with three consecutive sixes - which were to prove invaluable - in an unbeaten 145. Wendover started well in reply despite Fin taking a wicket in his first over. Both he and Will took some tap from Merrell## sulking in the twos## who hit boundaries to all parts of the ground when challenged to do so by an unusually vocal Stu Clark. A change of pace was required and the ball was thrown to Ben and Miles. However by the time the third wicket fell at 132 in the 22nd over## the oppo were on track for an unlikely win. The two spinners gradually slowed up the runs as we starved Merrell of the strike. When he was dropped on the boundary things looked bleak. However he was eventually well caught by Will on the Cow Corner boundary (much to Stu's delight) for a fine 78. Ben &amp; Miles completed their match winning ten over spells and fin and Philip## bowling his first senior spell## combined to wrap up the Wendover innings just 21 runs short of their target. Whilst at first glance this match seemed a cricketing and verbal duel between two batsmen who should have been playing for their first teams## there was a fine supporting cast. The BWCC youngsters## in particular 11yo Max Conway## subbing for a very poorly Ben Carlin## and Philip saw lots of action in the field and saved a lot of runs. The bowling attack## notably Miles## refused to back down in the face of some aggressive batting and eventually emerged on top. A slick stumping from the Dude merits a mention## and a big thank you to Fiona for an excellent tea and to Miles for officiating once again. The laurels however belong to Stuart for his batting masterclass.</span></span></p>",,2015-05-17

1286,"<p>Having lost the toss## Ballinger found themslves bowling first on what looked a perfect strip. In the event## a bowler's graveyard was a better description. Last year's league champions set off at a cracking pace against a weakened bowling line up## lacking a pace bowler. To make matters worse the outfield was lightning fast## although as the innings progressed that mattered little## as the batsmen increasingly chose the aerial route. Although the scoring rate was fast## there was some success for the bowlers## and would have been more had some chances not been put down. Andy Thompson held a fine catch on the boundary## and a clutch of LBW's contributed to Bourne End being 213 for 7## with 32 overs gone## so Ballinger were certainly still in the game at this stage## with spinner Monty Thompson having taken two wickets in his first over at a cost of 4 runs. His next three overs cost 49! Similarly## Nick Adams## coming on for his second spell## had respectable figures of 1 for 42 off 9 overs.His last over went for 32.... The cause of this destruction was M Shah## who after a watchful start produced a batting masterclass## making a fine 102 before being bowled by Ian Davies## with seven 6's and 10 4's in a fifty ball innings.&nbsp;Bourne End's final total was 337 for 9 - a record score against the club!</p> <p>After savouring an excellent tea courtesy of Jan Kerry## Ballinger set about the monumental and probably unlikely job of scoring 338. Any chance of making an interesting game was immediately scotched by the Bourne End skipper setting a run saving defensive field from the very first over## together with the early loss of Rollo McIntyre## very unfortunate to be adjudged LBW## as he was the in-form big hitter most likely to keep up with the requisite scoring rate. Danny Draper batted beautifully for a well deserved 53## and there were useful contributions from Matt Riley (21) Ian Davies (26) and Jonno Lacey (21)## but the target was increasingly out of range. Monty Thompson&nbsp; did his&nbsp; best with a very aggressive 54## and was undefeated when the overs ran out## with Ballinger short of their target by 117!</p> <p>Arguments against the concept of ""win/lose"" league matches are strengthened by this type of match situation. The real winner of the day was Jamie Kellock in producing such an ideal batting surface. We just need a ground twice as large to complement it!</p>",,2015-05-24
1349,<p>On Sunday Ballinger took a trip out to the lovely part of the county that is Bledlow Ridge</p> <p>The team had elected Dan Battman as captain and he immediately lost the toss. An afliction well known by other Ballinger captains.</p> <p>Fortunately &nbsp;the hosts elected to field which meant Dan got his wish with The Waggoners having first knock.</p> <p>A pair of Edwards opened up for Ballinger and put on an excellent 46. Edward O'Doherty was the victim of a freak dismisal when he was caught off a delivery bowled whilst he was still asking the umpire for a guard.</p> <p>Cyrus and Toby then rattled up 35 with some great shots plus some brilliant running between the wickets. Toby in particular was very positive.</p> <p>Harry and Tom W didnt lose a wicket but their indecision when running singles was a reminder to the coach to practice it again in training next week. They also came across Bledlows best bowler in 9 years old Molly.</p> <p>Noah and Matthew were again a bit uncertain with their singles but Matt made up for this with some great hitting adding another 32 between them.</p> <p>Harvey and the skipper finished off the innings with another good stand of 26 but with Dan being bowled by the excelent Molly## Definitely no disgrace there.</p> <p>325 is a formidable total to chase down and Ballinger's bowlers and fielders## well marshalled by Dan## were in no mood to let Bledlow get anywhere near it. The two Edwards set the tone but all the bowlers did well although the coach was suprised to discover that the Waggoners had conceded the same numbers of exytras as the hosts.&nbsp;</p> <p>A special mention must go to Noah who took 5 for 2.</p> <p>We have two wicketkeepers in this age group but neither were available so the team were indebited to Toby who did a brilliant job behind the stumps with only 5 byes bieng conceded.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A good win at a pleasant ground with hospitable hosts.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-05-24

1399,<p>Ballinger won the toss and decided to field first. Opening bowlers Max Hayes and Josh Field took 4 wickets for a handfull of runs and this was followed but good bowling from the rest of the team with special mention to James Batchelor spin bowling that had Beaconsfield batsmen thrashing at thin air. Fielding was good and resulted in 4 catches and 2 run outs. Beaconsfield amassed a total of 258 for 6 which at the time was probably 30 runs short of a good target.</p> <p>Ballinger batting was rusty and unlucky but on the positive side James Batchelor and James West were are only not out batsman.

1325,<p>Another sunny day in Ballinger as we welcomed unbeaten league leaders##Frieth## to the home of cricket. Despite Will &amp; Tom being plundered by the Firsts and top batsman Stu unavailable##the 2s were still able to field a strong side and blood 'new boy' Steve (another distinguishing nickname required ?) Best. Having won the toss the skipper inserted the oppo on what looked like another flat## batting track. Openers Fin &amp; Matt initially struggled to hit their straps but Fin finally found a good rhythm and Matt claimed a wicket due to a nonchalantly taken catch at mid off by debutant Steve. Despite this## it was clear that we needed to take pace of the ball as Frieth were ticking along at more than five an over. Miles took the second wicket in a short spell but Ben D - little Ben ? - also struggled initially to find a good length. The drinks break came at a good time and Freddie## who had already started to slow the run rate## claimed opener Tanveer in the first post drinks over## the Dude obliging## snaffling the catch behind the stumps. Ben was now finding his line and length and conceded only 21 runs from his last six overs## notwithstanding two mammoth sixes## and he and Freddie slowed Frieth down## despite them having seven wickets in hand. An unusually disappointing fielding display was stopping Ballinger taking a firm grip on the game and despite two run outs## Frieth were able to chance their arm in the final overs and a total of 206 - 6 looked a par score and possibly up to 20 runs more than they would have got had the fielding been up to its usual high standard.</p> <p>After consuming a fine tea provided by the Dude (and Lizzy!)## Ben C - Big Ben - opened with Matt## having been asked to build a solid platform from which the rest of the team could attack. They did just that## starting slowly but gradually ticking up the run rate. Matt## who had found it difficult to pick up the openers## despite one very fine drive through extra cover## perished in the 15th over with the score on 45. Big Ben was joined by Nigel## finally getting a bat this season## and the pair upped the run rate before Nigel had to limp off## having damaged his hamstring. Little Ben joined his namesake and the run rate continued to climb - but so did the asking rate which was up to 8 an over by the time Big Ben departed for a 72 - a good mix of patience and aggression. We then lost wickets at regular intervals as a succession of batsmen attempted to match the required rate and when Pads departed## BWCC required 34 from 16 balls - a tall order. A six from Fin## off his second ball gave a hint of what was to come## but with no boundaries in the 39th over and the Dude departing off the final ball## it didn't look good. 17 to win off the last over and a ninth wicket pairing of Fin and Miles## who between them had only faced a handfull of balls between them this season (such is the strength of 2s batting !). Nigel was frantically strapping on his pads over his jeans and his recently showered and gelled torso. A four and a six from the first two balls produced a great deal of excitement from the pavilion but a single from the third ball brought Miles on strike. He cannily squeezed the fourth ball backward of point for three runs which left Fin needing three from the last 2 balls. A wide eased the pressure and with all the fielders now in the ring Fin drove the penultimate ball down the ground.&nbsp;</p> <p>A great win## with good performances from the Bens &amp; Freddie and another top Clark performance (who needs Dad !). Thx to Miles &amp; Dave for officiating. Three wins on the bounce - bring on Knotty Green.</p>,,2015-05-31

First change bowler Salter immediately slowed the scoring rate## and dealt Ballinger hopes a blow by bowling Richard in his third over for 29## with the total 37. New batsman Andy Thompson was rapidly into his stride## and with Danny now locating the middle of the bat## prospects for a win looked good. 99 runs were on the board when Danny fell for 35.

More tight bowling from Archie and Tim started to rein in on the KG optomism and Casper struck with an inswinger that knocked off the bails followed by another middle stump for him from his last ball## so two wickets to Casper## Finns over was rewarded as well by a great catch by Freddie from his second ball## three wickets in the spell and KG are on 234 after 12 overs.</p> <p>The cold seemed to be causing us some catching challenges and we were missing some simple run out opportunities which normally would be sucessful. Tims second over resulted in one Bye and smart fielding by Finn thrown straight to Max who dispatched the bails for a run out## Freddie bowled a tight over replicated by Kuran who had been delivering unplayable pace and bounce## finn was then again rewarded by a catch by Tim at first slip## KG are on 231 from 16 overs.</p> <p>Dot ball bowling by Archie in the last spell followed by another wicket from a Casper ball caught by Oliver## Thomas provides a further catch for Casper in Mid Wicket and the pain for KG continues## Kuran bowls the last over## 5 dot balls and a single and the match ends with KG on 237 for 8 from 20.</p> <p>Thanks to the mums and dads who braved the cold and for helping tidy up afterwards.

1326,<p>It is unfortunately the lot of any successful side## that others will look on and covet it's stars. One immediately thinks of the Chesham United team from the 1968 Amateur Cup Final or more recently Bale##Modric## Carrick## Berbatov just a few names that spring to mind who have been plundered from more talented teams by those with more sway. So after three successive victories it was little wonder that the likes of Stuart &amp; Fin Clark found themselves in the first team this weekend. A more general player shortage exacerbated the situation and the 2s turned up shorn of many of its regular bowling options and looking a shadow of the side that beat Frieth the week before. Once again winning the toss the skipper opted to chase## believing it would be hard to defend any total below 250. It's probably best to gloss over what happened next. Suffice to say that despite an improved fielding display the bowlers## and there were seven of them## never got to grips with the sloping Knotty Green wicket. Only little Ben went for less than a run a ball. There were some highlights though. Newbie Andy Berry took a great catch## on the run in the deep to dismiss Raza for 108 off just 54 balls &amp; also claimed a run out with a slick piece of work at extra cover. Byeless keeping from the Dude on a difficult wicket to keep on was also creditworthy (in contrast there were 19 in our reply). Both Bens bowled well## 13yo Phil claimed his first senior wicket and the skipper added another to his season's tally. Never down hearted ( not sure that's true -ed ) the skipper rallied his troops over tea convinced Ballinger could make a good fist of the batting. The Bens had bowled 20 overs but gamely stuck their hands up to open. They started spiritedly before Big Ben departed to the Greens opening chucker. Wickets fell regularly at one end after that## but Little Ben remained there at drinks## looking set on 41 of our 81-4## and having been joined by Nigel. Disaster struck first ball on the resumption and with it all hopes of an unlikely victory as the skip's batting targets were revised downwards. However Nigel and Pads combined for a fifty partnership that saw us past the halfway target. Nigel unfortunately had to retire for the second successive week when## having battled with a rib injury throughout## it was that hamstring that laid him low again. He was quickly joined by Pads whose carefree innings was terminated by the Miles finger. Andy Rowe## watched by fianc&eacute;e and his new born## batted with typical verve and secured us maximum batting points whilst the skipper held up an end. When they departed it was left to another debutant Scott Devereux and young Phil to ensure we weren't bowled out. Thanks to Miles ## who once again had to umpire both ends## and in particular to Scott &amp; Andy for enabling us to field a full team. Next week Downley will face the backlash !</p>,,2015-06-07

They had put on a fifty partnership against the opening pace attack in fluent style## aided by a spate of no-balls from P Ottaway## at five an over## when S Daluwatta and S Dasanayaka took over## with the result that the runs dried up## and Ian then fell## caught## for a valuable 20 off Dasanayaka's first over. David Livingstone. also on first team debut## went in his second over. Carlton Siddle now joined Andy. They repaired the damage## but batting was now a struggle## with bowlers well on top. To get the scoreboard moving risks had to be taken. Only three short of what would have been an excellent fifty## Andy was caught on the boundary## and then Carlton going for a quick second run found that he was not as fast as he had once been. That made it 120 for 6## with only six overs left## and the innings petered miserably out for 136## a total around 100 runs short of competitive on such a good&nbsp;pitch.</p> <p>And so it proved. Ley Hill openers B Ford and C Petersen were never remotely troubled## apart from one or two half-chances. Skipper Maciver switched his bowlers regularly## but without success. Both batsmen had scored fifties in impressive style## and a ten wicket defeat appeared inevitable until Andy Thompson scooped up a diving low catch## to send back Ford## off Dom Brown## with only three runs left to win.</p> <p>The difference in class between the sides showed clearly why Ley Hill deservedly are unbeaten league leaders. Quite apart from their batting## their ground fielding and throwing showed Ballinger's up in a bad light - the age profile doubless a major factor!&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks are due to Ian Maciver who managed to provide and organize teas## with significantly greater success than willing&nbsp;his team to victory! Also to Liz Thompson for once again coming to the rescue as scorer.</p>",,2015-06-07
1398,<p>A complete team performance by our eager U9s.</p> <p>Ballinger chose to bat so that we could provide two spare fielders to the visitors. James and Josh put on a very strong platform of 47 runs## followed by Maxim and William Curry adding a solid 20 together (net of a run out by our loaned fielder - Josh Field - nice!). Charlie and Skipper Kit then came in and pushed us onto a nice round 300. This coach was enjoying watching the good calling and watchful batting against the GX best two bowlers. Noah and Joe then added a further 27 runs## with some wonderful power hitting from Noah in particula-##and then Elliot and Thomas eased the total up to 348 (net of a last ball bowled-out of Elliot). So a very handsome total indeed## helped by 25wides from the oppposition## but a credit to our discliplined batting. Losing only two wickets was really impressive.</p> <p>We knew that accurate bowling would guarantee the win## but I was really proud with the way all of the bowlers and fielders applied themselves. We chatted about keeping the wides down and fielding energetically (not giving overthrows and pressuring the batsman). Kit marshalled his bowlers and fieldsmen efficiently## and what was heartening was hearing all of the players encouraging each other. That is a sign of good team - boys. Charlie opened with some accurate fast bowling and Joe held up the other end very tightly. Two wickets in these overs## meant GX did not get off to a flier. The rest of the bowlers all followed suit; Josh## Thomas## Noah## Maxim and Elliot gave the batsmen nothing to hit and even kept the extras down. William Curry (not in list above because late to get added to register) bowled two really impressive overs with 2ov 2w for 3runs. James and Kit then bowled four overs## completely strangling their two best batsmen (batting again). The visitors could only make (net) three runs from these four overs.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was a complete performance. Well led by Kit## the team all played for each other and had fun## as did I. Well done all of you.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sharkey 7.6.15</p>,,2015-06-07
1427,<p>Sunshine at last and in the abscence of our Cup Captain Sebastian## Max stepped up to take the helm.</p> <p>I wanted to use this game as an opportunity for the boys to work on tactics## field placement and keeping the pressure on for 20 overs and the boys all excelled themselves with Max managing the field well and putting them under pressure.</p> <p>I think the statiscics speak for themselves## we clearly were a completely different class to our opposition who were brave at everystage of the proceedings and it probably isnt fair to disect the game in too much detail## however i must point out this is one of the biggest score differences i have seen over the last few seasons.</p> <p>The side also had four of our U10 squad## many of whom are becoming regulars in our U11 side.</p> <p>I saw commitment from the boys when we were put in to bat## a head never went down when we occasionally lost a wicket## usually because of a batting error rather than strong bowling. Particularly strong batting from Victor and Jack who were placing the ball all over the ground and also Tim who i havent seen smile quite so much whilst he found the middle of his bat several times. The other boys also delivered some excellent strokes against difficult bowling which on many occasions struggles to find the strikers end.</p> <p>With so much depth in the side all of the boys scored losts of runs and in true ballinger style they stole singles and two's at every opportunity## good exaplles being Toby##Will##Casper##Raphi and Max.</p> <p>I wish i could show their strike rates as well as it clearly shows a side playing as one - <strong>Great Teamwork</strong>.</p> <p>We left the field on 344 - Our boys could have relaxed## but Max kept banging the drum and made sure that every over was going to count.</p> <p>Please do take a moment to look at the bowling statistics - i will try and put it in a bit more perspective for those who werent there -</p> <p>Runs Scored from batsmen off the 120 balls - <strong>14 </strong>&nbsp; Extras 24&nbsp;</p> <p>The boys did not give anything away right to the end## in fact there were only 3 rund scored from the last four overs.</p> <p>Everyone bowled a good line and length and our spinners Victor and Will were super creating catching opportunities. Casper's first ball was knocked up for Max to catch## Finn took two other great catches## then Victor picked one up in Mid Wicket## Raphi's quick fielding and great throw into Jack gave us a run out. Raphi just bowled straight with a good line and length and was rewarded with three maidens with one wicket.</p> <p>Max decided that Jack should keep wicket and his decision was clearly a good one## Jack was solid behind the stumps picking up any wayward leg side balls and pinging the stumps at any sign of the batsman being out of his crease## we clearly have a talented keeper and batsmen in Jack who is new this year to the club.</p> <p>What impressed me today was the way the boys focussed on every ball and kept the pressure on right to the end## it is so important that they continue to learn and develop as circketers and understand the tactics involved.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well done to the parents for making sure the boys were punctual## and thanks again to the players who behaved as true gentlemen.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-06-07
1341,<p>Ballinger batted first on a a sunny evening and it felt like summer had arrived at last.</p> <p>Our opening pair went all out from the start. Unfortunately it didn't pay off as the boys lost five wickets in their four overs. Edward O'D went for all-out attack but had taken too many risks too early. At the other end Edward Batchelor scored a useful 16## including a cracking straight drive. The next pair## Charlie and Matthew## steadied the innings but we were only on 199 after the first eight overs which seemed below par. Then Victor and Jack came in and got the scoreboard moving. Victor played an excellent innings and was joint top-scorer with 20## including four boundaries. Next in were James and Harvey who kept things moving forward. &nbsp;Raphi and Toby were our last pair - they really put the pressure on the opposition with some impressive batting and running. They added 15 in their first over## including three consecutive boundaries by Raph(as he joint top-scored). Their four overs added a total of 40 without losing any wickets and taking Ballinger to an innings total of 278. It looked to be a competitive score.</p> <p>in the break the boys and match officials were treated to a lovely tea and some delicious scones and cookies. Thank you Nicky.</p> <p>Ballinger put GK under pressure from the start with a combination of accurate fast bowling and very good fielding. Edward O'D got the first wicket in the second over## and from then on GK lost wickets at regular intervals. Edward B## Victor## Toby ## James and Raph all took wickets. Raph was the pick of the bowlers &nbsp;with 4-4 off his three overs## including two consecutive Bowled in the last over. Toby was a very mature and able captain throughout.</p> <p>Ballinger's fielding was excellent too and put Great Kingshill under even more pressure leading to seven run-outs. Jack's wicket keeping was super and was one reason for this. The ground fielding was excellent . Our boys took some good catches too## led by Harvey who took two catches.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a result GK's innings limped along and never really got going. They briefly got ahead of 200 with their fourth pair## but they slumped back as their last pair were torn apart by Toby and Raphi's excellent bowling and the team's fielding. Great Kingshill finished on 179 having lost 17 wickets in total. We had won by 99runs after an impressive all-round performance.</p>,,2015-06-08

Max Dugdale (104* off a mere 55 balls) and Rob McIntyre (58 retired off 49 balls) set the tone of the innings within the first 5 overs with 49 runs coming from them. Rob later retired due to having cycled 90 miles the day before## leaving Max to continue the big hitting. It was at 150 runs when the first wicket fell of David Livingstone (5)## who hit the ball to a fielder calling for a sharp single## unfortunately only to be sent back and left high and dry by Max Dugdale. &nbsp;Paul Branigan (33 off 45 balls) did not miss the opportunity to score some runs. Max reached his ton a few balls before drinks and was persuaded to retire and not go for the record held by Will Smith. Andy Rowe was next to cash in with a few well timed shots piercing the mid wicket boundary to speedily get him to 34 of 22 balls## to later lose his wicket to a very good caught and bowled. Hamish (12* off 6) and Matt (3* off 2) came in to finish the innings off before the customary declaration before what was a wonderful tea from Debbie Sim.

A very attacking field was set with everyone around the bat or in the slips. There was an amazing catch made by Rob off Matt&rsquo;s bowling at silly mid off## diving to his left like an athletic youthful teenage boy.

Kuran and James marched on and again faced the openers## and they again batted well and pushed us to a very respectable 278 from the 20 overs.</p> <p>Our bowlers started well with Kuran opening with Daniel## Daniel took a great wicket bowling their skipper out first ball. Louis moved the bowlers around and we kept their score down## however wickets were not forthcoming and despite amazing fielding from Matthew## Harvey and James we were not being given the run outs despite great speed from Freddie behind the stumps.</p> <p>We kept them to 257 from 9 overs and then Casper bowled a maiden and they seemed to start to feel the pressure## we only gave away another 16 runs over the next six overs so we were level at over 15 but with no wickets falling we had a big job to do and as the tempreature dropped to minus 7 celcius and the light began to leave us Jai their opening bowler came to the crease and found the boundary four times and also hit a six## so with strong hearts the boys battled on and despite losing the match played the best they could in difficult conditions against a strong side.</p> <p>Once again thanks to all of the parents especially Nicky for wizzing accross Berks and Bucks to get Freddie to the ground and to Lara for helping us by letting Charlie step up at the last minute## he now no longer needs to step up as he showed he is more than capable playing at this level.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>kindest</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-06-10
1425,<p>Cup fever hits Ballinger. A team of teenagers + wily old Richard## Stu &amp; the Dude took on the might of Holmer Green and sent them packing with a bloody nose. In what must rank as one of the best performances by a Ballinger senior side## the 2s with the help of ROK beat a HG side containing not only several of their first team but also amongst the League's best batsman &amp; bowler ( Watt &amp; Jermain).</p> <p>Starting briskly Richard and Monty had taken the score past 50 off 6 overs before both perished to the bowling of Jermain. Stu quickly followed but Max &amp; Freddie set about rebuilding the innings until Max made it 4 down at the halfway stage with the score an impressive 77. A repeat of that would see BWCC safely home. However wickets continued to fall at regular intervals despite cameos from Ben &amp; the Dude. Jermain was brought back into the attack and we were all out for a par score of 126 with a valuable 17 balls still remaining.</p> <p>Will &amp; Freddie opened the bowling and a direct hit from the boundary by Matt ?## despatched opener Little. However Watt continued to keep the score around the required rate helped by Purkayasta until the latter was also run out after a mix up. Rickett &amp; Watt batted sensibly## taking the score into the 80s with 7 overs left## so a little over a run a ball was needed and HG now looked favourites. However quick wickets from Fin &amp; Matt unsettled them although Watt still remained. The crucial moment came with the score on 104 when Watt drove Matt down the ground for what looked like six runs but was well taken on the boundary by Dom. Jermain hit Matt for six off his first ball to leave them just 15 short but then fell LBW next ball. The 15 they required off the last over ## bowled by Dom## never looked likely and as they tried three times to take 2 runs to fielders on the boundary - and lost three times victory was ours## much to the delight of the shivering Ballinger supporters on the boundary.</p> <p>A real team effort## well orchestrated by Stu.

The bowling was just as good with Leo Wilson bowling his leggies and starting us off with a maiden over##Redbourne struggled to 27 off 8 overs with all the bowlers bowling tidy and tight.</p> <p>Second game against Old Albanians saw them bat first and once&nbsp;again struggled to 27 off 8 overs. Highlight of the bowling was William Yarroll taking 2 wickets in his over## but all players bowled well. Chasing we got off to a steady start with the run rate with Josh## Max and William S upping the run rate at the end of the innings (very proffesional).

Openers Matt Riley and Danny Draper appeared to have been paying close attention to the new-look England approach## and boundaries started to flow at a remarkable rate## with neither batsman appearing to have any difficulty. It came as a surprise when Danny risked playing across the line## and perished LBW##with the total 48 in only the sixth over. &nbsp;Worse was to follow. 48 for 1 was soon 60 for 4## Matt (30) caught behind off a lifter## Richard mesmerised second ball by the sight of a hookable ""gift"" delivery## and Ian Davies caught for only 2. Rollo McIntyre and Jono Lacey steadied the ship## and managed to keep the scoreboard ticking over nicely## but at 91## Rollo was caught for a well made 32## including two trademark sixes## and with his departure one felt that Ballinger's hopes were subsiding fast. Jono nicked one to the keeper soon after##&nbsp;having batted well for 16## but Nick and Ian Maciver clung on to see the score reach 135## but when Nick went for a brave 15## the end was nigh. All out 144 represented a seriously disappointing performance after such a good start. This was a match that was eminently winnable## even though we had by far the worst of the conditions.</p> <p>It was a pleasant reminder of the ""old days"" in&nbsp;village cricket## when a number of the Downley players joined us in the pub after the match## for a few pints.</p>",,2015-06-14

1423,<p>The sun finally broke through and our combined cup and league fixture was about to commence with Oliver at the helm who chose to bat first on the Beaconsfield astro strip which is well known for its bounce. Archie and Sebastian opened up and managed to take four quick runs off good staright bowling## we then lost three wickets from the next twelve balls with a bowled##catch and a run out and we were into a strange area of negative runs## not somewhere the boys visit very often## Archie found the boundary and Seb was cut off twice at the boundary but managed to run two's##but nine from their last over pushed us back to par.</p> <p>Next in Oliver and Tim who should start pushing us northbound## another run out and dot balls and then finally a boundary## another difficult over and Tim has his off stump nicked by the round red thing## into over three and we are back under the 200 mark and the boys are starting to read the ball better and with eight from over seven and ten from their last over they leave the square with us on 216.</p> <p>Finn and Will take their positions and and taking their time they dont lose a wicket and take sensible singles and then they both find the boundary. Putting the ship back on course we move forward to 234 from twelve overs and the Beaconsfield bowling doesn't seem to be letting up with excellent fielding from their boys.</p> <p>Kuran and Toby take to the square and a direct hit from a fielder caught Kuran short on what looked like an easy single ## but the boys kept their heads up and shoulders back and Toby played straight and was rewarded with four singles and a two## Kuran found the boundary and the pair took the score up to 252## starting to be defendable.</p> <p>Thomas and Max took their places and Thomas played carefully and then struck out with a six a followed by a four## Thomas sadly lost his off stump fom a decent inswinger and Max finished off the proceedings with a four## the boys pushing us on to 269 for 8.</p> <p>I could sense that our side were gelling even better than last year and this was about to be witnessed by the spectators.</p> <p>Oliver opened the bowling five dots and a single with swinging quick good length balls## Kuran took the second over and was delivering at a very awkward height and at quite a speed and was rewarded by a great catch by Thomes. Oliver's second over changed the shape of the match with him only going for one run and the loss of three wickets## the first an amazing pick up by Finn &nbsp;at deep in the Gulley with a direct hit at the stumps## this was followed by Oliver smashing th stumps and another run out by Max. Beaconsfield were iin all sorts of trouble on 185 after three overs## Will Nettlefield was played well off the batsmans legs and then the boy was caught## the wickets just kept coming## Thomas came on and dot balls a two and a nick off the legs in the air and Max caught around the leg side with two other fielders homing in should he have not been in position.</p> <p>Archie rewarded second ball by a catch by Sebastian## BEaconsfields strong batsmen find the boundary a couple of times and Thomas and Will go for a few extras. Some amazing fielding by Tim stopping boundaries and Sebastian was a fraction of a second from making the most amazing diving catch.</p> <p>Totally committed in the field and under the constand direction of Oliver ## with all of the boys making sure there were no gaps in the field.</p> <p>Tim was rewarded first ball with a fine edge straight into Max's gloves and Finn rewarded with a straight bowled from his first over. Beaconsfield are on 210 from 12 overs and Olivers side are clearly in total control. Toby's fiorst over is a wicket maiden followed by another wicket for Sebastianand Beaconsfield are going backwards being on 199 after 14 overs## Toby's next over he gives only two runs away and Sebastin bowls a maiden## they are on 201 from 16. Archie switched ends for his second over and wasnt finding the lift he had from the other end but he tried to adjust## Kuran then bowled four dots a single and hit the stumps and Oliver hit middle stump two balls on the trot furtehr adding to Beaconsfields problems. Kuran finished off the proceedings with them only reaching 207 for 14 from their 20 overs.</p> <p>Well done to all of the boys## through to the next round of the cup and back up the league table.</p> <p>Thanks again to the parents for all of the support .</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-06-15
1343,<p>Sunshine and a lovely grass strip## Beaconsfield chose to Bat and Toby opened up the bowling ## followed by James## and straight away we could see that Extras were going to be the star of the show with Beaconsfield not doing too much with the ball## a tidy over from Edward Batchelor gave Ballinger a small piece of relief and whilst our bowling was very respectable we were not being blessed with too many wicket opportunities despite quite a few edges. Beaconsfield continued to tick along adding four or five an over then the second breakthrough for Noah in over 10 from a catch at square leg taken by Harvey## with the hosts on 246## then a wicket for Harvey and an unplayable ball from Edward best claimed a wicket## finally pressure being applied and a slow down on the run rate## moving into over 14 and they are on 249 for 5 . Wides from a few of the boys and not the sharpest fielding was punished by the Beaconsfield batsmen who remained alert with clear calling and with no other wickets until overs 19 and 20 for Toby and Edward## a superb pick up by Noah in the field ## speedily dispatched to Edward Batchelor gave us a well deserved run out## however Beaconsfield by now had pushed their total up to 297## a big score on this wicket with such large boundaries## again extras had been the star of the show.</p> <p>Toby put in Edward Batchelor and Noah## who unphased by the Beaconsfield openers played with the upmost confidence and scored eleven from their first over## nine from the second##ten from the third and seven from their last one## we were well ahead of the game on 237 when the pair left the square. All that was needed was patience and no risk taking.</p> <p>Jack and Victor were faced with tight bowling and excellent fielding which resulted in two well administered run outs## so they were taking the runs off as quickly as they were adding them and the side remained on 237 after eight overs## a target still achievable. Harvey and Daniel were again pinned down by straight careful bowling and sadly played around a couple of inswingers and they left the square on 219.</p> <p>James and Edward Best took up their position and James played a text book cover drive for 4 &nbsp;and also found gaps for singles and two's but luck was not with them and a run out and a couple of catches undid their hard work## pushing the total to 222 from 16.</p> <p>Unphased as all Ballinger players Toby and Freddie walked out and asked me how many runs they needed from each ball 3.16 to be precise to win and proceeded to try and achieve it. Sadly Beaconsfield had work out their plan and set a defensive field. As happens when just in and trying to send the ball skywards one can miss time it## notwithstanding that the boys facing a great left arm slow medium found the bondary and lots of other runs## putting on 39 but sadly losing 36 with the loss of 6 wickets leaving the side on 225 from 20 overs.</p> <p>The match was played with good spirit and whilst the end result is not very flattering i can say with some experience that in a rematch it could go the other way. Hopefully the end of season play off with give the boys the opportunity to demonstrate my opinion.</p> <p>Great moments form all of the boys and a huge thankyou to the huge support from all of the parents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-06-16
1365,"<p>As Esther Williams sang ""What a difference a day makes"" [yes i did google it] seems an apt song for yesterday## completely different body language and heads held high [except when batting].</p> <p>Will Nettlefield in his first role as skipper and a side of two U11 and eight U10.</p> <p>Jacob the Gt Kingshill captain [who sadly was very badly hurt last year in this fixture] chose to field.</p> <p>First ball first over and the bails fly off. oops## but that was really the only nervous ball out of the 120 that were presented.</p> <p>Will and Edward Batchelor settled in and pushed the score to 211 from their spell with Great K bowling a decent line and length. Noah and Daniel came in and a young bowler called Tahil delivered a maiden with very difficult lenght balls which Noah defended like a master## Daniel and Noah then picked up their pace and took tidy singles and both located the boundary## all going to plan and then a close run out## but we were still moving on up and the pair returned to the pavillion on 221.</p> <p>Edward O'D and Edward Best further put on the pressure with good running between the wickets with Edward O going at quite a pace between the stumps## Edward B played particularly well off his legs finding some nice gaps in a well place field. The boys pushed the score up to 245 and James B and Max FE came in ## Max defending the straight difficult balls and punishing the less accurate ones## again with great running## calling and backing up. James B hit three fours ## one being a text book effortless cover drive## without a loss of a wicket they pushed the side up to 273 from 16 overs.</p> <p>Jack and Toby faced the opening bowlers for their spell and as quick as they were putting the runs on they were having them taken away## none the less Jack found the distant boundary and took lots of singles with Toby who played with a nice straight bat## holding the score the boys finished on 271 for 7 from the 20 overs## a very defendable total on this wicket.</p> <p>Teas and biscuits provided very kindly by the mums and after Edward O'Doherty ate his own body weight in custard creams we proceeded back out into the field.</p> <p>The boys knew what to do and Will set about sticking to his plan## a blistering run out second ball from a great pick up dispatched to Jack at the stumps from Toby's second delivery applied immediate pressure. Tidy bowling was to follow from Edward O' and Will then Edward Batchelor struct the stumps and Gt Kingshill were on 205 from 4 overs. Daniel bowled straight and accurate ## Noah hit the stumps from his fourth ball following two dots## Edward Best went for a single and then Toby fired a pick up to Jack and another run out from Toby's second over. Max FE sent down five dot balls and then a no ball and Kingshill are on 205 from 8 overs## their mountain was getting higher.</p> <p>A Maiden from James Best added to their woes along with few runs being given from the boys second overs## but no further wickets were to fall between over number seven and the 18th over## however strong fielding and superb keeping kept the score well away from our total. A delightful Caught and Bowled for Daniel## a straight bowled for Will## closely followed by another chance for Will## sadly he had to dance around the batsman and didnt quite hold on to the catch and in the last over from Edward Batchelor a great caught behind from a find edge by Jack.</p> <p>Great Kinghshill managed to get to 238 for 7 from their 20 overs and with a fairly matched side we held them back with sensible batting## strong accurate bowling and committed fielding.</p> <p>Well done to Will and the boys and a thank you to the Great Kingshill coach Chris who was full of encouragement to his boys.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2015-06-17
1432,<p>A sunny evening at a beautiful ground saw Ballinger play a rearranged home match away at Amersham. James Batchelor won the toss and decided to field. All the bowlers bowled well but the highlight was our aggresive throwing which netted 6 run outs. Max hayes was on form behind the stumps claiming his usual stumping. Our catching could have been sharper but its something to work on. I cant really single out any star performers with the ball because all the lads bowled well and restricted Amersham to 236 for the loss of 10 wickets.</p> <p>After a drink of squash please note no cakes (so far we are winning the league on teas and cakes) Ballinger opened the batting with James West and Joe Yalden providing a steady start with no major problems. Enter the two big hitters in James Batchelor and Josh Mandeville who put an impressive 48 run partnership with James hitting a powerful flat six off his last ball.&nbsp;This allowed the next partnership of Charlie and Max to just punish the bad ball##Harbin and Kinura followed suit with Harbin after an early scare soon finding his form with some impressive boundaries. Finally Josh Field and Noah facing Amersham best bowlers played with great maturity seeing Ballinger home in comfort.</p> <p>A very enjoyable match to umpire well done to all players.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-06-19

1328,<p>A good toss to win on a drying wicket so Ballinger were in trouble from the start## which was compounded when Big Ben was caught at slip in the first over. Little Ben repeated the shot two balls later## the ball just failing to carry##but then settled down with Andy to build a platform . Ben fell with the score on 41 but Matt then joined Andy and the pair were still together at drinks with the score on 85## and a target of 200 seemed achievable - a decent score given the conditions. However wickets began to fall at regular intervals after the break curtailing attempts to increase the run rate. Andy stayed defiant at one end until the burden of batting with his old man became too much to bear and he departed for a well crafted 61. Useful runs were added at the end along with a useful 10 wides in the final over which gained Ballinger maximum batting points## but left us shy of what was likely to be required.</p> <p>The rain at tea time 'freshened up' the wicket and breathed hope into the Ballinger fielders. An early breakthrough from Matt## when Miles held on to a trcky catch at mid off## meant a decent start and after three maiden overs## he had 0-1. However runs continued to flow too freely at the other end and Phoenix were managing 5 an over by the time Little Ben claimed their second wicket at 71. The third wicket stand## which saw both batsmen reach 50## was finally brought to and end when after some great work by Matt ## the Dude completed a run out. By now Phoenix had reached 138 and had ample number of overs left to complete the formalities. However Ballinger would not go down without a fight and wickets from the skipper## two from new boy Simon and two more from Matt made Phoenix battle all the way. Matt's 3 for 30 off 9 overs and Simon's 2 for 12 off 5 overs were particularly noteworthy and had the skipper realised the talent he had at his disposal a little earlier## or one or two difficult chances not been spilled## we might not have gone down to a narrow defeat.</p> <p>Thanks to Jan & Nigel for an excellent tea & scoring respectively (the right way round methinks) and Miles for umpiring once again. Despite the defeat it was good to get a game in after last week's disappointing wash out. A trip to Aylesbury awaits us next week.</p> <p></p>,,2015-06-20
1290,<p>Waddesdon decided to bat first in a game that was always going to be affected by rain. Indeed## the drizzle started soon after the start## and continued on and off## with increasing intensity## but play was only interrupted by one short break## in the eleventh over. The bowlers had to contend with a ball that grew ever heavier and soggier## so it was to their great credit that by the nineteenth over they had reduced Waddesdon to a shaky looking 66 for 6. In the absence of Nick Adams## who had failed to read the clear email instructions of the Team Secretary (and indeed possibly due to the lamentable lack of a fixture card this season?) and had gone to Ballinger## the opening over was bowled by Joe Hankinson## who struggled to find line and length bowling downhill. Nick arrived## grumpy even by his standards## in time to bowl the second over## and cheered up when it proved to be a maiden. Happier still when this second was a wicket maiden## courtesy of a blinding slip catch by Matt Riley.&nbsp;Grumpy again though when he was told he had to re-park his car## blocking someone in...</p> <p>Meanwhile Evan Webster had replaced Joe## and was soon bowling exceptionally well## and also pulled off a fine catch## giving Nick his second victim. Evan's 7 over spell of 4 for 20## two of them clean bowled## was most impressive. Unfortunately for Ballinger## their serene progress was badly held up when Waddesdon's No 7 Chaudry and 8 Irwin decided it was time to start batting sensibly## and put on 72 for the seventh wicket . The fielders did not help themselves by dropping several chances## although given the conditions perhaps that was unsurprising. Eventually## skipper Maciver could stand it no more## and brought himself on to wrap up the innings with 4 for 12 in 3.2 overs## by which time the scoreboard read 165 all out## in the 39th over.</p> <p>No sooner had the players reached the pavilion than the heavens opened## the thunder rolled## and half an hour later the pitch looked like a lake.&nbsp;Which was a shame## since the Waddesdon total looked in reach##&nbsp;given the strength of the Ballinger batting line-up. But we thought that last week too!!&nbsp;</p>,,2015-06-21
1351,<p>Home against an unbeaten Marlow## and Marlow lost the toss and our skipper Toby chose to put Marlow in to bat## with our regular keepers unavailable Toby threw on the gloves and set to field.&nbsp;</p> <p>Toby was ultra organised and was in control of the team from the start and with Edward O and James Bathcelor opening nothing was being given away and Marlow were on 210 after 4 overs but hadnt lost a wicket## giles and Teague both changed this with Teague finding middle stump and then James Garner recovering the ball at gulley and sending an accurate throw to Toby leading to a great run out. Marlow are now 216 from 8 overs with the loss of two wickets.</p> <p>Wicket maidens for Finlay and James G started to put the Marlow boys under immense pressure along with a maiden from Noah## this included a great run out facilitated by Tom##Marlow were now down to 208 for 4 from 12 overs.</p> <p>Another maiden for Noah and Tom and Finlay both bowling five dots and a wide each and then Guy Jarvis in his first match bowled a wicket maiden## so Marlow remained on 208 for 5 from 16 overs.</p> <p>Tom's second over came with two wickets ## both hitting off stump## Guy then bowled five dots and a single and Edward O and Noah finished the session off with continued pressure and Marlow finished on 207 for 7 from 20 overs.</p> <p>Following the consumption of vast quantities of squash and biscuits and flapjacks the side were briefed and we opened with James G and Guy## James found the boundary and the boys didnt lose their wickets and pushed us up to 219## already 12 ahead of our target## but this is barrington rules so anything can happen.</p> <p>Tigue and Tom faced some accurate bowling which was hard to get away and managed to defend it well and then two catches a run out and a stright bowled and we were back to 201 ## Tom and Tigue had managed some swift singles during their spell. Marlow's confidence now boosted they felt a victory was now possible.</p> <p>Giles and Finlay defended well and managed to hold our position which is what had been asked of them## we were now on 200 for 6 from 12 overs.</p> <p>Toby and James Batchelor took to the square and Toby found the boundary and James played three wonderful drives which all went for four## the boys didnt lose their wickets during their spell and pushed the up to 235 from 16 overs.</p> <p>Edward O and Noah took to the square and both found the boundary and added a further 29 rund from overs 17/18/19 ## Marlows quality leg spinner came on for the last over and tempted Edward with a great ball that found his off stump## never detered the boys run four more singles and finish the innings on 262 for 7 from 20</p> <p>A very convincing win against an unbeaten side## great fielding## very few extras and sensible play from all of the boys.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well done to the skipper for making my role easy## congratulations again to Guy on his debut and wicket maiden.</p> <p>Thanks again to Louise and Mark for arranging the teas and for ensuring the clubhouse was shipshape when we left.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-06-22
1435,<p>Having lost the toss on another sunny Ballinger evening## the skipper tossed the ball to Fin who promptly demolished the stumps twice in the first over. When sub fielder Hamish caught the other opener in front of the pavilion off Matt## Bourne End were reduced to 6 for 3 off the first 2 overs ! The rebuilding of the innings was further set back when their skipper collapsed in a heap as his knee gave way - a feat that he was to repeat several times during his three trips to the crease. By the time Will Reid and Freddie Thompson were asked to bowl## the opposition were trying hard to post a defendable score but by the time these two had finished their innings was in tatters - All Out for 110 in 17 overs.</p> <p>Stu &amp; Monty opened the innings and by just rotating the strike and picking off the bad balls##the score rattled along at a run a ball## and they always looked comfortable. Monty edged one on to his pads and the umpire's finger was up before the fielders could appeal. Debate raged as to whether the noise was louder or quieter than than the edged catch to Steve in their innings given as a wide !</p> <p>It mattered not## as Andy joined Stu and the runs were knocked off with nearly five overs to spare. Thanks to Richard for umpiring (he wasn't the deaf one !) and for the good support on the night. Well skippered Stu and another really impressive team performance.

The pair pushed us up to 303 for 7 from 20 overs.</p> <p>Refreshments and cakes very kindly provided by Edward's mum Caroline and with a very respectable score one would have thought the rest would be a stroll in the park## however this was a very different side to the GX from last year.</p> <p>Opening with Finn and Edward GX attacked from the very start with their U10 player finding the boundary with ease## a breakthrough catch from Finn's second over eased the pressure## but GX were on 234 from 4 overs## the match was far from over.</p> <p>Charlie Berens came on to replace Finn who had to head home and Raphi and Thomas came in for their spell## GX happily taking singles and the Raphi takes off stump for his first wicket and then two consecutive run outs for Thomas ## one of which he dealt the fatal stumping## some dot balls and then Thomas bowls the batsman from a slower yorker## GX pushed back to 232 from 8 overs.</p> <p>Tight bowling and a catch from Caspers first over followed by Casper hitting the stumps and a wicket also for Tim and GX are only on 238 from 12 overs. Seb and Kuran begin their spell and Seb gives very little away## and first ball of his second over is nicked by the batsman into the hand of Charlie who is fielding at fly slip## Seb then hits the stumps followed by a shorter ball from Kuran which is caught by Archie at mid off.GX are on 244 from 16 overs## so a difficult game for them to win ## but the last pair didnt give up and we were punished by three no ball 4's ## but Archie hit the stumps and then two catches ## another for Archie at mid off and one for Max behind the stumps.&nbsp;</p> <p>GX managed to push up to 260 and whilst a convincing win it was the toughest opposition so far this year and should we have been sharper in the field we could have held them back a further 30 runs or so.</p> <p>Big thank you again to Caroline for the match teas and looking after the clubhouse and also to the parents and boys for helping me tidy up afterwards## again i apologise for the late finish.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>kindest</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-06-26

1329,<p>Although it was another lost toss -its just an urban myth that the skipper hasn't won one all season. Nonetheless we were inserted & had to make the best of it. Although it was a young side it contained a decent line up of BWCC's finest and more experienced junior cricketers most of them with at least 3 campaigns behind them. Marcus & Big Ben led the way against a tight Aylesbury opening attack and a side that had won its last three matches. The pair took the score along to 39 in the 12th over before Ben took a chance too many. Tom then joined Marcus and the run rate began to tick up but Marcus##who had rotated the strike superbly## walked down the wicket and was stumped. It was a feature of our innings that it took a while for most batsmen to find their feet but all eventually got in and started to score well## only to perish soon after. Tom was run out after a mix up with Ben## new boy Kamal looked set and was beginning to really hit his straps when he perished and the same was true of Duggers (Little Ben to regular readers) and Miles. However the score kept rolling along and the skipper pushed things along at the end with help from Matt and a score of 193 for 9 would have been worth at least 225 back at Ballinger such was the size and length of grass of the outfield.</p> <p>The new ball was entrusted to Matt & Duggers and both found a good line and length right from the start. Whilst Ben strangled the batting from one end## Matt was removing them at the other - as Tom & Big ben shared four catches off his bowling - his venomous short ball accounting for two of them! When Duggers held on to a fiercely hit cover drive## Matt had his fivefor. Tom then clean bowled their sixth wicket with the score on 71 and the game seemed close to a conclusion but there were still 24 overs left and with our opening bowlers taking a well earned break## Aylesbury's 7th wicket pair began to rebuild. No further inroads were made as the score began to climb and they remained in touch with a run a ball needed. Those present then witnessed a spectacular catch from Tom at cow corner## who having initially misjudged the flight of the ball turned his back and began to run back towards the boundary. He then caught the ball ## arm outstrectched above his head## one handed in the back of his hand whilst running away ! An incredulous batsman ( and 2 umpires and 10 other fielders ) watched in amazement - but the dangerous Ferguson was on his way back to the hutch. Matt & Ben were then recalled and wrapped up the rest of the Aylesbury innings without too much resistance.</p> <p>A really satisfying team performance after a winless month## with most getting some runs and time in the middle## eight catches## another good spell behind the stumps from The Dude##a top notch fielding display & all topped off with Matt's 7 for 55. Once again thanks to Miles for umpiring. Lacey Green next up## and Captain Kerry will be looking for a similar effort from his legion.</p>,,2015-06-27
1291,<p>Visitors Aylesbury Town were doubtless overjoyed to win the toss on a sunny afternoon and a pitch that looked a batsman's paradise. But they were one down with only 6 on the board when Nick Adams saw Will Smith## keeping wicket ##take a good catch in his second over. Alas## that was soon forgotten## as the batsmen almost immediately started thrashing the bowling to all points. Acting skipper Andy Thompson tried to stem the flow with frequent bowling changes## but to little avail. Evan Webster## having seen his first delivery despatched for six did well to clean bowl Aylesbury's other opener for 26 in the same over## but by this time they had 102 on the board## with only 16 overs gone. Quick running## taking singles where there should not have been any## plus a badly dropped catch all added up to an increasingly bad day for Ballinger##&nbsp;but just when&nbsp;a total not far short of 300 looked on the cards## Carlton Siddle had the rampant S Ashraf caught for 89## and suddenly the game changed as he and Ian Davies started to get a firm grip on the scoring rate## catches were held and wickets started to fall. Will caught the eye with a couple of smart stumpings## and Aylesbury were now struggling to post a competitive total. Both Ian and Carlton ended up with four well-earned wickets apiece## as the innings closed on 206## with five overs going begging.</p> <p>Even with a much changed side## this target## on such a good wicket## should have been well within Ballinger's range. Yet within three overs they had lost two key batsmen. Danny Draper fell LBW to only his second ball## and Stuart Clark## after a sumptuous cover boundary followed by a towering 6## was well caught - an all too brief cameo. This poor start was rapidly put right as Will Smith and Joe Hankinson started to tear into the opening bowlers## but Will's stay was all too brief when he was caught in the slips for a rapid 18. Joe was now joined by Andy Thompson## and the scoring rate dipped considerably with the arrival of first change bowler&nbsp;W Mohammed##who had Andy fighting to connect with his away swingers. But it was Joe who was to be his first victim## clean bowled off&nbsp;by a superb delivery## having posted a most impressive and hard hitting 46. Jono Lacey had no answer to the same bowler## and it was now Ian Davies who joined his skipper in what was starting to look a difficult bid to win. Andy## after his early struggles## was just starting to score more freely when he was caught for 21. 117 for 6## but still 15 overs left## and our hopes lay with Ian## batting freely but circumspectly and Carlton. Together they took the total to 146## when Carlton edged to the keeper. Ian departed nine runs later for a patient 22## whereupon the innings rapidly disintegrated## 159 all out.</p> <p>Thanks are due to Jamie Kellock who stood in as umpire most efficiently## and to Nick Adams whose provision of a much appreciated tea took him a lot longer than his stay at the wicket! By and large## the bowlers came out of this match far better than the batsmen. There thoughts in the pub afterwards that perhaps we should ask Jamie to stop preparing batsmen- friendly strips and start helping the bowlers!</p>,,2015-06-28
1368,"<p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">It was pouring with rain at 5 but that moved off by six so we managed to play this top of table clash. Ollie was stuck in traffic so we were lucky to have Matthew keen to play instead and Charlie to be sub fielder for the opponents. Freddie won the toss and chose to bat.</p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">Ed Batchelor and Leo opened but got off to an unlucky start as Ed was runout by a direct hit on the second ball. They recovered well and took the score to 211.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Louis and Will came in next and showed some solid defence against some accurate bowling taking us to 224. The middle order of Toby and Harvey and then Josh and Mathhew all tried to get the score board moving but kept losing wickets at regular intervals## mostly bowled or run out.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Freddie and Ed O'D were the last pair and played very positively towards the end. This included a fantastic pull for six into car park by Freddie followed by a four off a no ball. But he and Ed<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>O'd both got carried away losing three wickets. We finished on 258 but it was disappointing we had lost 11 wickets.&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">Tea was provided by Jess which was much appreciated by everyone. Thanks</p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">It was always gping to be a hard score to defend. We started really well with the two Eds bowling fast and accurate. They each took a wicket and pegged back Wendover's openers to 200. Wendover's second pair got the scoreboard moving and they slowly pulled ahead from then on. Our boys bowled fair enough without taking wickets. Edward B pick of bowlers and I was pleased how accurately Toby## Josh and Leo bowled. Wendover's fourth pair took them ahead and they finished on 295.</p> <p class=""MsoPlainText"">&nbsp;</p> </p>",,2015-06-29

1352,<p>This re-arranged fixture was moved from Ballinger to Amersham just so it could be played but it isnt really a hard-ship visiting Shardeloes on a lovely evening.</p> <p>The boys were ready to rock and roll early and tonight's skipper## Noah## had laid his plans carefully. Having lost the toss he was pleased when Amersham chose to bat. He opened the bowling with James B so a seam and spin combination. This was effective when Noah took a wicket with his 3rd ball. James bowled a maiden from tghe other end. Noah though was going down the 20/20 route of not allowing the batters to settle and immediately changed bowlers at both ends</p> <p>Guy and Tom R took over and conceded just 8 runs between them in 4 overs## with each getting a wicket in their second over. Thus Amersham were only on 193 at the end of over 6. Noah rang the changes again by bringing on Tom W from one end and debutant Kit Sharker from the other.Once more this was an inspired bowling chjange with the boys conceding just 9 runs between them and Kit proving a real handful for both batters and Dan behind the stumps. A wicket with the 1st ball of his 2nd over was just reward.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-07-01
1369,<p>Very warm conditions and once all of the parents eventually found the ground hidden behind the thick lush hedgerows we were asked to field first.[so much for sat nav]</p> <p>Edward started off in a friendly and generous manner allowing a couple of byes and then as his generosity began to wane and with his fourth ball he smashed the top of off stump## Harvey followed from the other end and again gave very little away. four from his first and then just a single from his second over## Ollie Norton joined him with five dot balls and an extra## chenies on 207 from 4 overs.</p> <p>Tom bowled nice and straight and was hit for four from a short of a length ball and then was rewarded by razor sharp fielding from Edward which delivered a super run out. Victor was blessed with a catch from a top edge first ball## with Victor turning it with aparent ease## then three unplayable dot balls from a confused batsman## the spinners mandatory boundary and then middle stump from a gracefully floated ball## two wickets in his first over.</p> <p>Noah came on with his great line and length bowling which gave him five dot balls followed by Ollies second over which the batsman only managed one single from## Chenies are on 206 from 8 overs.</p> <p>Skipper Max now came on with his left arm over action and only gave them an extra and dot balls## followed by Leo's great length bowling which went 5 dots and a wide## BWCC again giving nothing away in the field. Victor on for his second spell and its a wicket first ball with the turn baffling the batsman.</p> <p>Dylan in his first match of the season was thrown the ball by the skipper and bowling his first competetive over this year went dot## straight bowled##dot##straight bowled##dot dot## so a double wicket maiden and cheers from all his fellow players and the third pair leave the square with chenies on 197 from 12 overs.</p> <p>Second spells for Leo ## with him going for just one bye##Tom hits the stumps with his third ball## much to his delight## Noah gives nothing away again and his rewarded by a catch at deep midwicket by skipper Max who eventually held on to the ball like a winning lottery ticket## Dylans second over he goes for just three runs and then a nother wicket in the form of caught and bowled## what a day for him## Chenies now on 192 from 16 overs.</p> <p>No more wickets were to fall for us as Toby now out of the keeping position which had been taken by Victor## bowled two decent overs along with Max and Edward## walking from the field for refreshments with Chenies on 212 from 20 overs.</p> <p>Fully refreshed Edward and Ollie opened the batting and Edward playing well against some slow and low bowling he managed four boundaries from his stint with Ollie## the pair didnt have much to hit at but pushed us into positive territory despite a wicket and run out so we were on 207 after 4 overs## just 5 short of our target . Harvey faced all six balls of his first over and scored 12 from it then Noah came into action as well and the pair pushed the team on to 239 with four boundaries for Harvey and one for Noah## we were well in front.</p> <p>Dylan and Tom with instructions from the skipper not to lose their wickets played perfectly ## defending and taking safe singles## not losing their wickets they pushed us on to a commanding 247 from 12 overs##winning a match is often about playing the situation you are in and Dyland and Tom did exactly that -well done.</p> <p>Leo and Max came in with the same thoughts in mind and with Max able to punish two wayward balls to the boundary and further growing the lead to 260 from 16 overs.</p> <p>Victor and Toby came in and didnt lose a wicket and both boys found the boundary rope with a particularly well timed and seemingly effortless drive by Victor## the boys added a further 21 runs from their spell and walked off the square finishing off a very convincing win.</p> <p>The fielding was a good as i had witnessed all season with the boys always in the right fielding positions## leaving very few gaps if any.</p> <p>Well done to Max and the boys## a big thank you as well to Victor who stepped in a Matthew unfortunatly had to withdraw at the last minute due to illness and we wish him better.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Steve</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-07-02
1366,<p>A hot summers night at Ballinger and several dehydrated boys arrive straight from school matches. an important fixture as we continue our rise to the top of the table.</p> <p>Wycombe chose to bat and Tim and Oliver open proceedings ## not many chances from the first four overs## but a tidy maiden for Tim## Oliver finding pace and length but most balls well outside off and the temptation not being taken by the HW openers## HW finish on a respectable 220 from the first four overs.</p> <p>Oliver brings on the spinners and what a great decision from the skipper. Will getting a run out from the first ball## three dot balls and then a caught and bowled and next ball a floater into the safe hands of Sebastian## HW down to 204## Sebastian is turning the ball and they cant get near it and last ball of the over it goes around his bat and hist the stumps## Will then bowls dots and a single and Seb bowls five dots and a single## so HW are 203 from 8 overs.</p> <p>Max and Kuran take the next spell and Kuran takes the stumps out with his extra pace ball## followed by a shorter ball straight to Oliver. Max bowls nine dots and gives a a four and a no ball## the pair keeping HW down to 215 from 12 overs.</p> <p>Edward## Archie and Finn come on and give almost nothing away ## a great run out Will throwing in to Finn from Finn's bowling and Archie bowling with great accuracy rewarded with a hit on middle stump. HW 223 from 16 overs.</p> <p>Edward and Finn add to the dot balls with their second spells and then Oliver sends the spinners back on to finish the innings## a stumping at lightening speed from Jack followed by an Oliver Webb run out## Seb takes the last over and again quicker than Bruce Lee ## Jack removes the bails again## so HW reach 233 from 20 overs for 11 wickets.&nbsp;</p> <p>The boys consume the jam doghnuts and juice and then Seb and Tim open## putting HW under immediate pressure with their desire to score from every opportunity## but there was an element of care and the pair proudly walked back to the pavillion with Tim finding the boundary twice with the side on 227## we need 7 more runs to win.</p> <p>Archie and Max take their place and get 12 from the first over## Archie smashing two well timed fours## target met. Max fell to a very tidy leg break then he managed to strike a full toss to the boundary## Archie followed suit and the boys walked back with the side on 249.</p> <p>Edward and Will knowing we want a large score differential continue with the climb and score well from each over## Edward running well and driving his fours with his usual grace## Will determined to score from the last ball charged the spinner and was caught with the popping crease some way behind him## great spirit and big smiles from both boys as they leave the square on 272.</p> <p>Finn and Kuran take their positions and off they go## Finn hitting six fours accompanied by Kuran who also hit three of them## the boys didnt put a foot wrong and drove the score up to 316 from 16 overs.</p> <p>Oliver and Jack both found the boundary each on two occasions## both boys playing some wonderful shots around the ground and continuing to push our margin up.

1438,<p>A hot sunny evening in High Wycombe saw Ballinger complete a comfortble victory over High Wycombe. William S captained his first game and started off by losing the toss and&nbsp;batted first to be honest with the under 9s this season it doesnt really matter wether they bat first or second.</p> <p>Max H and Harbin B&nbsp;started powerfully putting on&nbsp;33 with the loss of 2 wickets both cracking some powerful boundaries.Charlie W and Noah L calmly amassed 21 without losing any wickets## this was just what the team needed.Enter captain Snooks and debutant&nbsp;Tommy&nbsp;T who balsted 40 off their 4 overs with the loss of 5 wickets## this&nbsp;was the most entertaining partnership of the night with both lads attacking every ball with their stroke play and running between the wickets ( a scorers nightmare).&nbsp;Next in James B and Ary P&nbsp;who put on 29 for the loss of 1 wicket## special mention&nbsp; for Ary who took a bit of sledging from his High Wycombe school mates. Josh F and Josh M finished off the innings with 29 for the loss of 2 wickets against Wycombes 2 best bowlers. So we posted a solid 293/10.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ballinger bowling and fielding was the highlight of the night. Yes we may give away some overthrows but they are so aggresive in the field and always try for the run out and once again claimed 3 run outs.</p> <p>Ary P took revenge for sledging## taking 2 wickets for 9 runs. Max H took 1 wicket and then displayed his skills behind the stumps. Josh M bowled without luck taking 1 wicket for 7 runs. Harbin bowled quick conceeding 11 runs but had Wycombes batsmen jumping around. Charlie W solid bowling was rewarded with 1 wicket for 11 runs. James B leg spinning is outstanding once again should have taken more than 1 wicket.Noah solid bowling conceeding only 6 runs but he pulled off the catch of the season on the boundary. Tommy T bowling was excellent and caused panic with Wycombes batsmen&nbsp;resulting in&nbsp;2 run outs. Captain Snooks strong bowling only conceeding 10 runs and finally Josh F claiming 2 wickets for 4 runs. Wycombe total was 236 for 11 wickets.&nbsp;A superb team performance and after the game the lads voted Tommy Threlfall man of the match on his debut for his bowling and batting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-07-04

1292,<p>Another magnificent batting pitch## on a fine sunny day. Not a good toss to lose## but alas we did. Knowing Monks Risborough's reputation for rapid scoring it therefore came as a welcome surprise that after nine overs they had a mere 13 runs on the board for the loss of 3 wickets## with the opening attack of Nick Adams and Andy Thompson exerting a virtual stranglehold on the batsmen. Notable in this opening phase of the game was Ballinger's fine fielding. Richard O'Kelly pulled off a superlative diving catch behind the stumps## and Freddie Thompson an equally fine one on the boundary. Would this last? Answer - an emphatic No. Nick conceded 26 off two overs as the boundaries started to flow## although Andy continued to keep the other end tight. Skipper Maciver brought himself on## to see if some spin would change things## but without success. Instead## it was spin from the other end## when Freddie Thompson came on to replace Dad## that was to produce wickets## although inevitably at some cost. Joe Hankinson replaced the skipper## and immediately picked up a wicket## thanks to yet another wonderful catch## this time by Freddie Denison-Smith## and finished a good spell with another off the final ball of the innings. Freddie Thompson's spell of 4 for 50 off 9 overs was highly encouraging## and with Andy's 3 for 20 off 10 it could be said that the Thompsons were having a good day. (But see later!!)</p> <p>For the second week running it looked as if Ballinger had an excellent chance of overhauling what was really a quite modest target of 184## given the conditions. Matt Riley (especially!) and Danny Draper gave us a confident and rapid start## putting 59 on the board## before Danny missed one from first change bowler Bukhari and was bowled for a solid 18. Bukhari also accounted for Matt## whose tame dismissal caught and bowled for 40 was in stark contrast to his earlier aggressive stroke play. However## the writing was already on the wall## as not long before Danny was out he had faced an over of spin from the second change bowler## Fiaz## on which he could barely lay bat on ball. The trouble started when Richard O'Kelly## seemingly in no trouble at all## was victim of a fine catch## off Fiaz with the total on 82. Whereupon the traditional Ballinger mid-order collapse set in. Collapse is rather an understatement. Annihilation perhaps? 82 for 3 became 92 for 7. This included a Fiaz hat trick## accounting for Joe (caught). Andy T (golden duck- neat slip catch to a good ball)## and Monty T (golden duck## deciding most inadvisedly to pad up## and paying the penalty). So## no## the Thompson family batting was not up to their bowling! Sanity returned via an excellent stand between Ian Maciver and Freddie Denison-Smith which put on 43 for the 8th wicket## and showed that the game could still be won. But## sadly## Freddie who had batted stylishly## albeit mostly on the defensive## was dismissed by another caught &amp; bowled## followed by Ian## LBW amid scenes of near hysteria by some of the fielders## for a valiant 20## whereupon the innings gently subsided to 140 all out## just enough to secure the 75% bonus points (we trust!). A feature of the innings was the Monks Risborough fielding. They held some quite spectacular (even improbable) catches## yet their ground fielding was sloppy in the extreme - a massive contrast to Ballinger's.&nbsp;</p> <p>So## yet another story of a game that got away.

1345,"<p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">We were playing away on Sunday morning at Marlow&rsquo;s busy ground by the River Thames. Unfortunately one of the lad&rsquo;s had an accident so we were only nine players.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Edward and James Batchelor opened the innings. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>James## an under -9## <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>had an unlucky start as the keeper took a difficult catch running backwards. After that the brothers put together a really good partnership. Edward scored freely with five boundaries in a commanding 27 no## our top scorer. James played a supporting role but also cracked a boundary in the last over. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>A great start## 232 after four overs.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Dan and Jack came in next. Marlow&rsquo;s top bowlers were on. Sam## one of the fastest I&rsquo;ve seen at this level and a wily legspinner. It was a stern test for Dan and Jack and they both defended really well against excellent bowling although each was out once## Dan bowled and Jack stumped.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>In between they cumulated a few runs and took score to 241. Mathew and Harvey were in next. Both played <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>quite well although there was hesitation and a mad run-out. Edward O&rsquo;D and Jack batting again were the fourth pair. Ed was on the charge from the start and was bowled early on. His lofted drive later in the innings was quite a shot even though it didn&rsquo;t quite reach the longest boundary. Meanwhile Jack played a great innings of 14.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Our final pair were Toby (with 14) and Freddie(10). They played another excellent partnership against strong bowling. The only drawback came when Freddie was deceived and stumped off the leggie in the final over. We had finished on 293 after an excellent allround batting performance.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">We would need to bowl and field well as we were one fielder short. I wasn&rsquo;t to be disappointed and everything went well &hellip;at least for the first 19 overs. The standard of bowling and fielding were very high. Toby rotated the bowlers cleverly. Everyone&rsquo;s bowling was accurate although the first pair defended well. Wickets started to fall from the fifth over onwards. Against their second pair Ed O&rsquo;d bowled a wicket maiden Jack got a sharp caught and bowled and Mathew got a wicket first ball. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>The third pair were undone by the Batchelor brothers. Ed&rsquo;s bowling was really accurate all day as he took 3-7 off three overs - pick of our bowlers. James got a first wicket in this age group as Jack took another excellent catch at mid-off.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Marlow&rsquo;s last pair came in with the score on 228## needing 65 to win.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Their leading batsmen came in: Sam and George.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span>Sam was impressive## a very attacking batter and his dad a former England captain held in awe by our team. Toby and Ed initially kept things under control and Toby got Sam out caught in the penultimate over. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>At the start of the last over Marlow were on 251## 42 short## and Ed O&rsquo;D <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>was keen to bowl. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>But Sam was on the charge## cracking boundaries around the ground and unsettled <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>our bowler. It was nerve-racking with four fours and a couple of no-balls going for 27 runs. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>What a crazy over !</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Fortunately we were in such a good position from our excellent all-round performance that the last over didn&rsquo;t alter the result. We had won by 14 runs. Phew## what a relief! Well done boys. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>It was super to see everyone contributing## <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>such a good squad and playing with good team spirit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2015-07-06

As we amble back to the pavilion he asks if we would mind taking part in a short memorial service for a mate of one his team. Not believing his luck Captain Kerry obliges with the 7 players he has.

Finn is given the dubious honour of bowling the first over. The Green is one of the bigger grounds we play on so trying to cover lots of space with just 5 outfielders was going to be a bit of a problem. The rather portly gentleman on strike rather liked the idea of so few fielders and swung lustily at Finn&rsquo;s first ball and it duly raced to the boundary. He did this 4 times more during the over achieving a 50% strike rate. Dom is on at the other end and manages to bowl a tight enough line to only concede a couple of wides and then the rest of the troops turn up. A relieved captain waved them on only to be told that Miles had forgotten half his kit. Now this isn&rsquo;t what a frazzled skipper wants to hear. Miles has to field in shorts and finds himself running from fine leg to fine leg.</div> <div style=""font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;""></div> <div style=""font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"">Finn pins the other opener whilst Dom gets the same treatment from said portly gentleman. So after 4 overs the score is 24. The next 16 overs are completely bizarre as Finn and Dom complete 5 over spells for 11 &amp; 13 respectively## Simon bowls 5 overs for 11 and takes 2 wickets courtesy of a brilliant catch by Tom P## which## I&rsquo;m assured was nowhere near as good as his catch last week.

1293,"<p>An afternoon in the sun at the picturesque Bradenham ground is one of the season's highlights## especially as BWCC tend to win. Yet again our skipper lost the toss## but with a well balanced side available this week## there should be no problems. As indeed there weren't; only three quarters of an an hour into the match## Bradenham were 27 for 4## and reeling under the onslaught of a fired up Will Reid and the wily accuracy of Nick Adams. Will suffered two missed slip catches off his very first over## and by the time his seven overs opening spell ended## he had conceded a mere 14 runs## but had seen Nick grab all the wickets at the other end. But Lady Luck was not going to favour Ballinger today. Chasing a ball in the field## Carlton Siddle pulled up lame## and was thus unable to fulfil his role as first or second change bowler. The skipper therefore tossed the ball to Freddie Thompson## just at the time when the burly left-handed Ghafoor## after a quiet start## decided to impose his presence on the match. Poor Freddie went for 48 in his 3 overs## including 7 sixes## before the skipper had mercy on him. Ian himself was also suffering heavy punishment by this time. The scoreboard raced along## as Ballinger did not help themselves## grassing three opportunities to halt Ghafoor and the by now equally aggressive Kiani. Salvation appeared in the form of a passing motorist who took grievous exception to the ball rocketing into the side of his car## and was unimpressed by shouts of "" It's your own fault for driving across behing the bowler's arm"" &nbsp;etc## etc.- mostly by the Bradenham players naturally## certainly not Ballinger's! But the slaughter resumed. Ghafoor was eventually bowled by Joe Hankinson for 112## an innings which included 10 sixes and 9 fours. Joe also claimed the scalp of Kiani## stumped by Richard O'Kelly for 95 ( a mere 8 sixes and 7 fours). But not before the final straw in a miserable afternoon's fielding## when Andy Thompson's calf seized completely up while bowling his fourth over## and he had to be carried from the field## to play no further part in the game. Bradenham's sixth wicket put on 136. Their next highest stand was 33!</p> <p>A target of 257 would have taxed a full-strength batting line -up## let alone Ballinger's seriously diminished one. But evidently no such thoughts were in the minds of Danny Draper and Richard O'Kelly as they made a rapid and confident start. Danny cleverly managed to place his aerial shots so that they landed just over the fielders' heads## and with Richard hitting the ball with his usual power## and taking few risks## the total passed 100 in the 19th over## well up with the requisite run-rate. Danny went first## bowled## for an attractive 41## with the total on 113## and Richard followed quickly for an excellent 69. &nbsp;Those familiar with Ballinger's middle order batting need read no further. Rollo was batting in very restrained mode when## afflicted by the ""Shane Watson"" syndrome (i.e: propensity to death by LBW) inevitably took a risk and paid for it. Will Smith came and went## first ball## rapidly followed by Joe Hankinson. Nick Adams played sensibly## batting for half an hour for 16## but the run rate was now out of sight## and the aim had now to be achieving 75% target bonus. We failed in this## too## in spite of a nice cameo from Will Reid. Carlton came in at No 10## with a runner## but lasted only 3 balls ## and Andy could not bat. (The stats above show ""retired"" as there is no provision for ""Absent hurt"" - action NK/webmaster please!)</p> <p>Many more batting failures like this## and Ballinger's place in the Premier Division may be drawing to a close!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2015-07-12

Widmer End's opening bowler## Overmeyer## provided a brisk start to the game; extracting enough bounce from the track to keep the bowlers interested. Any early width was punished by the openers## who initially looked comfortable. Opening from the Village Hall end## Wyatt set about a ten over spell of dropping the ball on a decent line and length## without really doing much with the ball. Monty was extremely unlucky to play-on while sweeping - the ball only just having enough momentum to dislodge one bail by the time it eventually reached the furniture. Clark perished soon after## trying to hook one that was too short and too wide to play at that early in the innings. Jono joined Basty at the crease and took a liking to Wyatt; dispatching him twice to distant parts of Ballinger Common## before being trapped LBW to a ball hitting him high on the thigh (with a bruise to prove it). At 34 for 3 off eight## what BWCC needed was someone to dig in and occupy the crease; while still dispatching the none-too-rare bad deliveries - enter Toby Lyons. At 20 overs (65 for 6) the stand in skipper was simply hoping to achieve a score that would be even vaguely defendable - surely 120 was too much to ask for? While others perished around him## Toby continued to accumulate runs steadily while wickets fell at regular intervals at the other end. The tail then wagged. Fin adding 7; Will 14 and an excellent hard-hitting 24 from Evan; combined with a superbly constructed innings of 51 from Toby## took BWCC to a previously unimaginable 149. Despite turning the innings around## a score of below 150 still looked eminently gettable## given the track and conditions. Surely? An excellent tea courtesy of Caroline lifted the spirits and off we went. Fin and Evan started well; both extracting enough pace and bounce to make wickets look like a real possibility - Fin rearranging Afridi's stumps in the third over. Evan bowling tidily from the football ground end. Saffid joined Hobbs at the crease## and a partnership of 51 then seemed to be taking the game away from BWCC. Despite the steady progress being made towards the target## many of Widmer's runs were coming via a lofted route - this served to keep Ballinger in the game with a chance surely going to hand soon? Another partnership (31 runs between Hobbs and Shahzad) followed leaving the score on 102 for 3 off after 17 overs. Only 48 needed. By this stage the openers had been replaced by Will and Monty## and due to the patience and persistence of the Ballinger bowlers and fielder## the game started to change. Bowling to a 7/2 field## Will proceeded to bowl one of the best spells seen at Ballinger for some time. Line and length## and enough movement away from the bat to keep the slips interested## Will proceeded to collect 5 Widmer wickets for 24 runs off 7 overs. A truly game-changing performance. The real frustration being that he had to be withdrawn from the attack due to bowling restrictions. Never mind - Matt had been loosening up for at least 15 overs. Cometh the hour....... At the other end Monty plugged away with a spell of tight attacking spin bowling## picking up a couple of wickets for his toils. By the 24th over Widmer had reached 125 but with nine wickets down; the last pair now in and only looking to nudge their way to 150. All of sudden the game had changed - 25 runs seemed like a mountain to climb and the momentum was with Ballinger. Nonetheless## due to some stubborn batting and a few loose deliveries## Widmer found their way to 139 for 9 at the start of the 32 over. Having spent the previous few overs striking a balance of containment and attack## the stand in skipper elected for the latter with full force. Matt started the over with a single## bringing the less dangerous of Widmer's batsmen on strike. Further fielders were brought in to search for the final wicket and Matt sent down a short of a length delivery on leg stump which was fended off toward Toby at forward short leg. Toby appeared to react slowly## but then calmly stepped forward and snaffled the ball a couple of inches above the turf. Widmer End all out for 140. A fabulous win for Ballinger## who were patient and persevered even when the game looked well beyond them. Honours evenly shared between Toby (for batting with great control and giving us something to defend); and Will Arnold for a fabulous spell that changed the second innings. The Dude was once again very tidy behind the stumps and took his catches well. Many thanks to Roger for officiating## and Nigel for scoring and preparing the track (and generally pottering) so well.

1294,"<p>A rare event indeed at Ballinger## as skipper Maciver returned from the toss with a smile on his face## and the home batsmen smiled likewise##&nbsp;at the long awaited treat of batting first on the famous batting paradise. The smiles were short-lived. Matt Riley## apparently deciding that immediate all-out attack was called for## ballooned a catch to mid-off in the third over. 13 for 1 became 13 for 2## as Rollo guided his first ball into the grateful hands of slip. Eight runs later## Will Smith was unlucky##and the only person on the field.&nbsp;alas including the umpire##&nbsp;who thought he hadn't nicked one down the leg side to the keeper.&nbsp;For once it was now Ballinger's oft-maligned middle order which was called on to repair the damage. Ian Davies dug in for 23 dot balls##&nbsp;before starting to go on the offensive## whilst Joe Hankinson was striking the ball to great effect at the other end. Together they had raised the total to 51## when Ian fell to another catch by the keeper. Jono Lacey's stay at the wicket was all too brief (58 for 5) but Monty Thompson came in to give a demonstration of Thompson grit (his father watching helplessly from the pavilion## last week's torn calf apparently sporting a Dali-esque tattoo## but to the relief of all## actually a medical device!). With Ballinger's batting resources badly stretched by injury and unavailability## it was essential that this pair stuck it out## but just as the total neared 100 Joe edged fatally to slip## out for a valiant and at times aggressive 42## with one splendid 6. Thereafter## it was rapidly downhiil## and the innings whimpered to a sad end - a pathetic total of 121.&nbsp;Had Knotty Green held all their catches things might have been even worse##</p> <p>Having&nbsp;batted for&nbsp;only 35 overs## Ballinger then had three overs before tea in which to dent the Knotty Green confidence.The tea score of 24 without loss indicates their success.&nbsp; A welcome break for sustenance provided by the Thompsons sent the fielding side out again## to try and do better. They failed## spectacularly. The same opening attack## which had so dominated the early batsmen last week## was simply toyed with by J Patel. Will Reid was the pick## and managed to concede only 4 an over## but Nick Adams' three overs cost 33. A swift change to spin brought no relief whatsoever##as Ian Davies and Ian Maciver were both put to the sword. It was only when the score had reached ""nelson"" that Will Arnold## in his one and only over took two wickets## both clean bowled! Patel was unbeaten on 82## including 18 fours and 1 six. The match was all over at ten to five## Knotty Green taking 12 overs and three balls to usher Ballinger ever closer to the league trap door.

1332,<p>A warm sunny day at Wendover - a first for me as I had always thought it was twinned with Manchester - saw Ballinger in the field hunting another win. Fin &amp; Andy bowled a good variety - certainly enough to confuse the Wendover top order and reduce them to 41-5 as the fielders enjoyed some catching practice. Tight spells from Ben and Tom kept the 2s in the ascendancy whilst Freddie took wickets at the other end. Just six overs remained with Wendover languishing on 122 for 8## so the skipper## still euphoric after his catch## decided to feed them some runs to ensure more of his lads would get a bat. Once they had enough (177) he finally recalled Tom back into the attack and he promptly took the 2 remaining wickets with his first two deliveries.</p> <p>The Ballinger reply started badly as the Bens were both back in the pavilion with the score only just into double figures. Tom &amp; Kamal patiently rebuilt the innings## ever watchful on a tricky wicket## before both started to push the score along nicely## Kamal eventually departing for 32. Alex## playing his first game of the season## and still recovering from a dislocated shoulder## joined Tom and in another 50+ partnership took us within striking distance of the target before Alex too perished. Brief cameos from Pads and Andy and the loss of Tom left Freddie and Fin to get us over the line with three overs and three wickets to spare## Freddie's 28 coming at a run a ball.</p> <p>Another good win &amp; team effort so the Seconds Steam Train rolls on down the line## Hampden are next in line for the juggernaut.

Will and Rob began to rebuild the innings. Runs began to flow in until Will was given out to a questionable LBW by Max Dugdale! Rob soldiered through on what was a tough pitch while the wickets of Salisbury## Tegg and Kellock fell for the total of 12 runs.

Hamish ended his spell with figures of 3 overs## 4 runs and 2 wickets## with Stuart MacGowan coming on to replace him.

Fin picked up the last real batsman## effectively to end the game. The entertainment was not over## however## with Monty chasing hard to get under a high catch to finish the game## only to fall over &ndash; inexplicably &ndash; at the last moment## with the ball eventually landing inches from his head as he sprawled on the ground.&nbsp; He blamed his tumble on &ldquo;a hump&rdquo; in the apparently bowling-green-flat outfield.

Marcus played a few risky shots for 4 before he was bowled for 12. Rob stemmed the flow of wickets the innings with Toby## but this was at the cost of a slower run rate.

He got us off to a good start with very few runs coming from his first few overs. Monty&rsquo;s offspin at the other end was effective against the lefthander but less so against the right hander and Freddie Thompson took over. Meantime Harry picked up the first wicket of the left-handed batsman## who chipped a full toss to Rob at mid on. From Freddie&rsquo;s first ball he seemed to cause the remaining opening batsman problems. However from now till the last 15 overs proved to be a difficult period for Ballinger in the field. The opening batsman and their number 3 tucked into the bowling## even good balls disappearing for 6 off the number 3&rsquo;s bat into the tree tops. We were staring at defeat. It was not until around the 30<sup>th</sup> over when Freddie induced a miss hit slog from the number 3 to have him caught by a stunning diving catch by Rob on the boundary. Things began to look up as we quickly learnt that Hyde Heath only had 3 real batsmen.&nbsp; Numbers 1-3 scored 177 runs while 4-11 scored only 33 runs. &nbsp;Do the maths &ndash; we won! Freddie persisted from the same end## with the help from Harry and Monty from the other. A barrage of wickets fell in the last 10 overs as a result of tight bowling and restricting the strike of the opening batsman who stood on over 100 runs. There were run outs from risky runs in attempts to get the better batsman on strike.&nbsp; And when their opening batsman was caught## suddenly we were unexpectedly in a winning position; we needed 3 wickets off 4 overs with 38 runs to play with. With a run out and 1 person being bowled this left us with 1 wicket needed off the last 2 overs. Freddie took the 2<sup>nd</sup> last over &ndash; a maiden &ndash; they were now blocking.

Once Will was out Toby began to show more aggression and survived a succession of partners before departing in the 35<sup>th</sup> over for an excellent 78 scored at nearly a run a ball.

Nevertheless Matt and Harry## who were opening the bowling## managed to keep the Lee in check by bowling tight lines and waiting for the batsmen to make a mistake. Their patience was duly rewards as both the Lee openers were out in their 20&rsquo;s## A Morgan holed out to deep cover and A Harris was out lbw attempting to hit across the line.&nbsp; However the Lee steadily rebuilt through the Swain father and son partnership and at 100-2 with well set batsman our total seemed within reach.

However both bowlers struggled with their rhythm due to incessant rain-breaks and the slipperiness of the ball. The High Wycombe batsmen were less than sympathetic as despite a shortened innings due to the unrelenting rain and time spent looking for lost balls## they managed to post 235 for 9 off 32 overs. No one actually bowled badly but it&rsquo;s always difficult to contain a batting side at Ballinger when they are trying to smash every ball out the park. The Wycombe innings contained 16 sixes## highlighting the dangers of bowling spin at such a small ground like Ballinger!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a delightful tea courtesy of Veronica## Ballinger began the daunting chase with Richard O&rsquo;Kelly and Freddie Thompson batting circumspectly. However the watchful start quickly turned into a shambles## after Freddie&rsquo;s unlucky dismissal opened the floodgates and the Ballinger batting line-up capitulated in a manner similar to England&rsquo;s top order. Dignity was only restored by Basty who batted well for 30 and Monty as they ensured defeat was by fewer than a hundred runs. Credit to High Wycombe for bowling aggressively and to their fielding which was superb. All in all a match to forget as nothing quite went right for Ballinger against a talented and youthful Wycombe XI## perhaps the greatest achievement of the match was in actually getting a game in despite the inclement weather.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Will Smith</p>",,2015-07-31
1296,<p>The start of a new month## but nothing new for Ballinger## as they continued serenely on their slide towards Division One. Taking the field first there was early encouragement as Will Reid succeeded with an LBW shout off the fourth ball of the opening over. Thereafter it was all in favour of the batsmen## on the now customary batting paradise of a track## until a lightning strike by keeper Richard O'Kelly off Evan Webster's bowling saw the fall of the second wicket on 56. Thereafter runs continued to flow at a rapid pace. This was in spite of excellent opening spells by both Will and Evan## backed up by some of the best fielding shown by Ballinger all season. Both N Little and R Wallace had passed their 50's by the time Ian Maciver managed to get rid of both of them## then Lady Luck smiled briefly as the prolific P Weeracoon pulled a hamstring when he had only made 13## and retired hurt. Meanwhile the fielders were doing everything possible - good catches being taken by Fin Clark and Evan## and a superb one by Will Smith## &nbsp;Special mention## too for a magnificent piece of fielding by newcomer Brett Hopcroft ( not Luke as recorded below## as the website needs adjusting - Nigel please rectify!!)## who surpassed an already impressive show by a lightning run-out. Will returned for his second spell and promptly took three more wickets. returning 4 for 40 off 10## an excellent effort on such a wicket. Ian finished with 3 for 34## also off 10## and to have confined Holmer Green to 200 in such conditions was a creditable performance.</p> <p>One person who had been licking his lips at the prospect of bowling on a really hard track was Holmer Green's speedster Steve Jermain. He didn't take long to make the most of it## sending back Danny Draper and Will Smith with only 5 on the board## just the start Ballinger didn't need. Richard O'Kelly was joined by Brett## and they had put on 41 for the third wicket before Brett's increasingly fluent knock was halted by the sight of the umpire's finger. Therafter## chaos reigned## with the uncannily accurate (as well as fast) bowling of J Salter made mincemeat of the middle order. Standing firm though## was David Livingstone. His 6 over extra cover onto umpire &nbsp;Dick Beard's car came out of the blue## but he perished trying something similar. Not for the first time## Ian came in to play a true skipper's innings## batting 45 minutes for an attractive 18## then the last pair of Fin and Evan## even though batting in a by now lost cause## showed some of the earlier batsmen a degree of tenacity could keep Holmer Green in the field for longer than had at first seemed likely##</p> <p>Nevertheless## to be all out on such a wicket for a mere 121 served to underline what has been Ballinger's weakness since those far-off successes at the season's start. This was our 10th defeat in a row. Some kind of Club record?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-08-02
1313,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">On a hot day in Little Marlow and what looked a nice pitch to bat on## both teams were no doubt hoping they could bat first in pursuit of a big score. Unfortunately## Ballinger lost the toss and it was Little Marlow who had first use of the facilities. Ballinger opened the bowling with Will Arnold and Fin Clark who bowled with great control early on## putting a stranglehold on the scoring and picking up the wickets of both the opening batsmen. Shariff and Hussain began to rebuild the innings but at no great pace as Ballinger&rsquo;s change bowlers## Monty and Freddie Thompson were getting considerable turn from the surface and bowling a good line and length. Freddie&rsquo;s figures did not do justice to how well he bowled and on another day he would have had several wickets. Monty picked up wickets at crucial stages to keep the scoring rate down with Hussain the first of these after he&rsquo;d built a 50 partnership with Shariff. Shariff held the innings together but finally fell when Will returned to the attack. St Maur attempted to push Little Marlow to a defendable score late on with a quick fire 23 however## 155 seemed below par at the halfway stage and credit has to be given to Ballinger&rsquo;s bowlers who were bowled very impressively.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Ballinger got off to the worst possible start to their chase however## as their opening batsman who shall remain nameless decided driving at a wide delivery was a sensible approach to the first ball of the innings and nicked through to the keeper. Tom and Graham started to get the innings going thereafter with both finding the boundary fairly regularly before Graham was well held at 2<sup>nd</sup> slip. This brought Will to the crease who played some good shots in a quick cameo of 15 before he tried one shot too many and was clean bowled. Tom continued to impress at the other end playing some fine shots and he pushed Ballinger close to the finish line in partnership with Jamie## Steve and then Jake before falling with just 16 needed. Fin fell shortly afterwards leaving a possibility that a Ballinger collapse may allow Little Marlow to win the game. However## Jake saw Ballinger home with a destructive 29 unbeaten## which included a clipped 6 over square leg.&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Basty Richards</p>",,2015-08-03

1334,<p>A welcome return to Frieth after many years away and another table topping clash for a 2s team shorn of several of its mainstays as the Firsts holiday period kicked in. Another toss won and Frieth were inserted## with Harry &amp; Matt opening up the attack. Opener Umar was reduced to silence - albiet briefly and for the only time all afternoon - after Matt trapped him LBW early on. Ballinger's bowlers kept things tight## though punctuated with a flurry of no balls and wides that contributed 25 runs to the opposition total over the afternoon. The second wicket partnership of 90 was not broken until after the &nbsp;drinks interval##when Toby took a good catch off Harry's second spell. Wickets then fell at regular intervals whilst keeping runs to a minmum. the highlight being an excellent catch from Nigel at mid off that he hung on to as he tumbled downwards. However the last few overs proved expensive## yet again## despite a defensive field and Frieth posted a competitive looking 186 for 8.</p> <p>The opening Frieth bowlers showed why they are top of the league and runs were hard to come by even before Toby perished in the fifth over. Ben &amp; Matt then settled down to construct a good second wicket stand of 49 before Ben slashed at one and picked out the only slip. Nigel then joined Matt and looked very comfortable adding another fifty with his increasingly desperate partner. Nigel then returned a gentle catch to the Frieth skipper and &nbsp;Matt## with a party to organise and having failed to hole out## despite some aggressive strokeplay## fled the field on reaching his fifty - the opprobrium of his mother being more scary than the censure of his team mates !</p> <p>The innings unravelled from there as some rash shots combined with some slow batting increased the size of the task. Only a resilient 23 from the Dude kept us in the hunt and when he went so did any remaining hope. The behaviour of a few of the opposition was way out of the line## much to the embarrassment of the Frieth regulars - such a shame the game was disfigured by it## as their captain## their umpire as well as poor old Dude &amp; Nigel found themselves on the receiving end of abuse.</p> <p>A disappointing result from a game we should have won but hopefully we'll put it behind us next week back at the home of cricket.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-08-04
1335,<p>Having already penned a slightly abridged version of War &amp; Peace (more War than Peace !) on this game I will try to keep this as brief as possible and focus on our fine cricketing performance.</p> <p>The skipper won the toss -again- and decided to let the oppo take to the field on a hot afternoon. A lack of KG players led to some discussion before the rump of their team belatedly and reluctantly took to the field. Instructed not to take too much advantage of the situation openers Ben &amp; Tom kept the score ticking over at a run a ball until the final car load of players finally showed up. After a lengthy stoppage in play our brave lads resumed their innings with no drop in the scoring rate. When Duggers departed with the score on 49## Matt (having by now tidied up after his party) joined Tom## who was already taking more than his fair share of abuse. The two of them looked untroubled and put on nearly a hundred as Tom proved to their fielders that he really could bat despite their assertions and threats.</p> <p>Matt eventually perished LBW## but on a hot day a fresh batsman was unlikely to slow the run rate. Kamal &amp; Tom sailed along at around 8 runs an over and Tom passed his century. With Tom on 125 there then occurred a very rare## and possibly unique## cricketing incident. With all the fielding side bar the wicket keeper by now on the boundary Tom blocked a ball and gave the ball to their keeper. The KG skipper then appealed for his dismissal and declined to withdraw the appeal when asked to do so by the umpire. Whilst there have been around 50 dismissals for handling the ball in first class cricket in the last 140 years Wikipedia does not contain a single incident such as this - the other dismissals involving elements of obstructing the field. The skipper joined Kamal as the last four overs went for 43 and 259 for 6## even on a belter of a wicket## was always likely to be a winning total.</p> <p>After a fine tea from Heidi (thank you!) Will &amp; Matt were thrown the ball and started tidily. When The Dude pouched one from Matt the writing was already on the wall - given the scoreboard pressure that was being applied. Debutant Dinesh the Destroyer was brought on and the oldens continued to demonstrate that they too can catch as first Nigel and then the skipper held on to their chances. With Sam picking up a wicket as well## the skipper decided to halt the carnage and rested Dinesh. Unfortunately for KG this only meant Tom &amp; Will coming on and wrapping up the remaining five wickets in just 20 balls with the Dude## Matt &amp; Nigel continuing to get catching practice. Of course## in this game## even that couldn't pass without incident and a fullscale row developed when Tom celebrated despatching his nemesis## the oppo skipper## rather too exuberantly - fortunately Heidi dealt forcefully with the unruly KG players in the pavillion.</p> <p>A big thank you to Miles for keeping his temper whilst subject to constant abuse.</p> <p>What a game ! We were left wondering how they behave when they think they have a chance of winning if this is what happens when they are totally outplayed. The tranquil - I hope - setting of Downley for the 2s next week - think I'll go to the Lane to watch a gentlemanly sport instead !</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>##</p>,,2015-08-08
1297,"<p>A visit to table-topping Ley Hill with a bowling line up so young that only the skipper could bowl a spell of more than 7 overs## on a very warm sunny day## and a lightning fast bumpy outfield## was not a very likely recipe for success.&nbsp; So full marks to Ballinger for reducing Ley Hill to 104 for 5 in the 24th over. Will Reid bowled fast## and was unlucky to go unrewarded## but Evan Webster and Harry Livingstone picked up a couple of wickets each## with Ian Maciver also in on the act. The fielding## on such a difficult outfield## was exemplary;&nbsp; Richard O'Kelly contributed a superb stumping## and Stuart Clark a wonderful running catch on the boundary. However## that was the end of Ballinger's success. Try as they might## the bowlers could not dislodge Richard Clarke and the ever dangerous Suranga Daluwatte## and both were unbeaten when the innings closed on 238 after 40 overs. One or two sharp chances were missed## but on the whole the fielders did their very best to limit the onslaught.</p> <p>Ballinger's reply was a welcome contrast to previous weeks'. From the first&nbsp;over Stuart batted like a man possessed## and had he continued thus## the game would have soon been won. Alas## after his quick-fire 33 (all bar one in boundaries)## he was unlucky to pick out a fielder with yet another attacking shot## with the score on 42. Meanwhile## Danny Draper who had mostly defended solidly at the other end## now started to go on the offensive## supported by Graham Salisbury (making a rare Saturday appearance).The total had reached 115 with only 21 overs gone## when both of them fell to S Dasanayake. Danny was bowled for an excellent knock of 52##and Graham for 18## which included a spectacular 6 off a no-ball. With Daluwatte now on## and purveying his baffling spin## one feared the worst. And so it proved## although the other spinner## L Thompson was the one who dealt the most crippling blow## having Ian Maciver superbly caught first ball off his own bowling. Thus 115 for 1 had become 140 for 9 in the space of 13 overs.&nbsp;Our batsmen should really have been wearing the ""baggy green""## perhaps....?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only enlivening event occuring when umpire Robin Carr## racing to change a broken bail## tripped on the pavilion step## and fell cutting his face. As he had given us no complaint regarding his decisions## he deservedly received sympathy## and was substituted for the rest of the innings. A defiant little partnership between Will and Evan saw us past 150## to gain an extra batting point## but the game ended in the 26th over## with Ballinger all out 155.</p> <p>Thanks to Derek Richards for standing as umpire. He at least emerged unscathed!</p>",,2015-08-09

1298,<h1>Winless since the 16th May## Ballinger took the field in phlegmatic mood against Downley## a side against whom we traditionally come off worst. A smiling skipper announced that he had actually won the toss## and decided not to risk his somewhat depleted batting line-up on a pitch that had received a couple of days' rain. A decision immediately vindicated## as Will Reid's third ball castled key batsman J Cox## and gave Ballinger an advantage that they never let slip. Will followed this success by claiming the other opener## also clean bowled## with only 24 on the board## and things got even better when Evan Webster had the powerful A Brown well caught by keeper Max Dugdale## without further addition to the score. In his next over Evan struck again## as the stumps went flying## and Downley were starting to look vulnerable at 31 for 4. With both Will and Evan age-limited to 7 over spells## it was now vital the change bowlers maintained the pressure. With a choice of spinners at his disposal## skipper Maciver now opted to try the tantalising leg spin of Freddie Thompson## to such great effect that the runs almost completely dried up## although George Cook went for a few boundaries when he over-pitched. However## Downley's 5th wicket partnership had managed to put on 54 before Freddie had his first overdue success. This heralded a complete collapse## with Ian Davies now in on the act## and the Ballinger fielders holding (almost) all their catches. Some lusty blows by the number 10 merely delayed matters slightly (and unfairly damaged Freddie's remarkable figures!)## and a surprisingly subdued Downley were all out 115## giving Ballinger's openers a potentially uneasy 8 overs before Helen McIntyre's welcome (organic)tea.</h1> <p>Without a recognized opener to partner Danny Draper## Jono Lacey was given the job. The innings got off to a cracking start## the very first ball yielding five off a no-ball - a good omen. Unfortunately## Jono's stay was brief## one handsome boundary going to his head! So## at tea the score stood at 27 for 1. Danny made his usual watchful start## conscious that there was a lot on his shoulders if Ballinger were to defy their batting reputation this season. With Rollo McIntyre also having to curb his natural instincts## it was to their great credit that they saw the score up to 67 before Rollo could restrain himself no longer## and departed caught## for a very valuable 18. A further wicket was lost with the total on 78## when Max edged to the keeper## but Danny was by now batting fluently## and a flurry of boundaries saw him past his 50. Ian Davies## returning after apparently weeks somewhere in the sun## kept him company with a solid display at the other end## and the feared batting implosion simply never happened.as Danny finished the match off with a rasping four## and a superlative 60 to his name.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both sides were missing some key players## but not for the first time it was Ballinger's young cricketers who set the tone with their excellent bowling and fielding. Whether this victory will come too late to save Ballinger from the drop is in the lap of the gods## but two more wins from the last two games might do the trick.

1337,<p>Opportunities for the 2s to visit the picturesque Monks Risboro ground have been non existent since the demise of their 2nd team## so for nearly all of our team this was their first visit to one of the League's trickier grounds. Our nomadic hosts Phoenix XI were themselves only playing their second game at the ground they had hired. With the skipper unusually losing the toss BWCC had to field on the hottest and most humid Saturday of the year so the strong bowling line up would be used to its full extent. Whilst it's a difficult track to bat on it's just as hard to bowl on it and our quicker bowlers were always likely to struggle to come to terms with the sloping run ups.</p> <p>Phoenix got off to a flier but were reined in once their opener dragged a full toss from Duggers on to his stumps. Matt and Little Ben then bottled up the batsmen## runs dried up as did the throats and by drinks at 15 overs the oppo had reached 64 for 2. A couple of chances went begging off Matt but when Will started his 2nd spell he and Ben took 3 wickets in successive overs. Some agricultural batting got their score moving again but Big Ben picked up a couple of wickets and the tail was wrapped up after 34 overs for 148 all out.</p> <p>After a decent tea it was time for the non bowlers to give it a go and with the lesser spotted Duggers making a rare second team appearance he finally got to strap some pads on. Unfortunately he was soon taking them off again leaving Basty &amp; The Dude to carry on the fight. Steve soon followed Max but Basty and Dom built a solid reply. After drinks they picked up the pace before Basty missed a straight one. Big Ben dwelt out of the traps and having reached cruising speed too late## quickly returned to the pavilion. The skipper and Dom built a good partnership but with the former walking singles the latter decided boundaries were more suitable. Paul departed ## caught in front by a grubber## but not before Dom had passed 50 - having no excuses for not batting properly this week ! We were still 34 runs short when he returned a simple chance back to the bowler## but with plenty of batting talent to come the result was never really in doubt. Finn## Matt &amp; Tom completed the formalities.</p> <p>A game played in a good spirit and another fine team effort. Job done it was off to the pub to bid farewell to the Dude and help drown some first team sorrows.</p>,,2015-08-23

1338,<p>The final league game of the season arrived - another friendly tussle with fellow promoted side Aylesbury 2s to decide the bragging rights for next season between 3rd and 4th place. I must be careful what I write as their skipper ##Nick## is an avid reader of our match reports !&nbsp;</p> <p>Lost the toss against them again but we took to the field with a good degree of confidence as we were able to pick a nearly first choice eleven - but we were soon retrieving the ball from all parts of the ground as their opener## Phil opened with half a dozen boundaries. Tom c&amp;b their captain and then Phil struck a fierce shot off Fin straight at the skipper who had little option but to defend himself and then hang on to the ball. Two down for just 30 runs off seven overs and things were back on track - but the Aylesbury batting line up was to prove stronger than usual. The third wicket pair put on 62 taking advantage of too many loose balls and a couple of chances also went begging. However Big Ben and the return of Tom brought a measure of control## as they claimed numbers 3 &amp; 4 in quick succession. Freddie passed the pads to Duggers at drinks and then made camp at the Football Stadium end whilst Fin returned at the other. Both bowled well but the occasional bad ball was punished and we managed only one wicket in the next dozen overs. At 152 -5 with just seven overs left things were looking ok## but some disappointing ground fielding## a few more four balls and with wickets in hand the oppo had reached 211- 6 before Freddie took wickets with last 2 balls of the innings.</p> <p>A fine tea from the Clarks (thank you) - with plenty of sausage rolls for everyone - and we were ready to resume. The skipper top loaded his batting order with Stu##Tom##Toby &amp; Nigel## and sat back to enjoy the rest of the afternoon - or so he thought. The opening bowlers kept it tight and we sleepwalked (almost literally in Tom's case) to disaster. By the time Toby was out## Nigel had endured his only lifetime golden duck## and we were rocking at 37 for 4 off 10 overs. Freddie (wickie##bowler and now batsman) was joined by Big Ben and they saw off the opening attack and then made the best of the change bowlers. By the time Ben was out## the total had passed 100 and little Ben then continued the good work. So much so that we had overtaken the Aylesbury score with nine overs to go - an unlikely victory was within our grasp. However Ben and Freddie departed in quick succession and the game was nearly done. Pads and the skip staggered us over the crucial 75% target line to earn the two points that would keep us in third above Aylesbury.</p> <p>A very enjoyable game played against a decent side (still reading Nick ?) and a good end to the season even if we couldn't make it a winning one. Very many thanks to Miles who yet again umpired both ends - where would we have been without him this season ? Thanks also to Dave for scoring.&nbsp;</p> <p>There were 3 tons and thirteen 50s (don't remember that many jugs) from nine different batsmen. Only three fifors - though all memorable ! - &nbsp;meaning 11 different players achieved a benchmark game. We used 36 players - slightly less than previous years - though only 20 played more than twice## so we kept a core squad together fairly well.</p> <p>All in all a very good season## only slightly marred by the unpleasantness from Knotty Green 2s - and it appears we are from being the only ones to have endured that this year. The lads have certainly justified the League's decision to promote the 2s at the end of last season and it is to be hoped that the next crop coming through can do as well - who knows we may well be seeing some mixed teams next season ! Of course we now have the opportunity to finish the season on a high by claiming Ballinger's first ever trophy## come along and support us at Bradenham in T20 final next Sunday## 11am start.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-08-30
1300,"<p>If the unknown Aylesbury couple who planned their weddiing for the 29th of August 2015 had only known the significance of their great day..... &nbsp; The outcome was that half the Aylesbury Town first XI were invited## leaving the rest to face the might of a power-packed Ballinger team intent on clinging on to their Premier League status. Once someone had been found to unlock the changing room## stumps and a scoreboard had been found## a successful call by skipper Maciver saw Aylesbury invited to bat first## and there followed a bizarre self destructive exhibition by their senior players## in the face of superlative bowling by Will Reid and Nick Adams. By the eleventh over they were 39 for 7## even after some woeful catching by certain senior Ballinger fielders## which must have made Will in particular spit nails. That they did not roll over completely was due to some intelligent and watchful defence## mixed with some fortuitous slogging## by their last four batsmen. A couple of good catches improved Rollo McIntyre's day in the field## Will Smith contributed a stumping## and Ian Maciver and Evan Webster saw to it that Aylesbury's recovery was snuffed out## and the innings closed leaving Ballinger with the trifling target of 101 to win.</p> <p>Cognoscenti of Ballinger batting prowess might raise an eyebrow at the description of ""trifling""## but surely.....? &nbsp;With eleven overs to navigate before tea## Matt Riley and Danny Draper's approach was the antithesis to Aylebury's earlier batting## as maiden over succeeded maiden##and the Aylesbury bowlers showed a great deal more competence than their batsmen - as Matt was to find out## when castled in the fifth over## with the total on 4. In came Rollo## and soon lifted the rate with a couple of boundaries## so that Ballinger went in to tea at 23 for 1.</p> <p>Suitably refreshed## Danny and Rollo continued with their steady progress## with Rollo## conscious of the utter necessity of victory## batting most reponsibly. Danny## by nature## doing exactly the same! &nbsp;Nevertheless## both were beneficiaries of dropped sitters## so the ""wedding god"" was still smiling on Ballinger. With no further alarms## Rollo in particular now started to open up## with a trademark six high into the tennis court netting. Aylesbury tried seven bowlers -probably their captain had never seen some of them bowl before## especially the round-arm slinger in the ASDA T shirt## but to no avail## as Ballinger cruised to victory by 9 wickets. Rollo finished with a very well-deserved 54*## and Danny a patient and increasingly confident 37* - how we have needed his style of batting in recent weeks!</p> <p>One could not but feel sympathy for our opposition## who were so friendly in adversity! &nbsp;However## the victory was all the sweeter for hearing that Holmer Green had unaccountably managed to lose to our arch rivals in the relegation stakes## Knotty Green## who must have thought that salvation would be theirs.</p> <p>Analysis of the final league table points may well show the contribution made by the Umpiring/Scoring section to the Club's survival. So Dick and I would like to thank our unheralded colleagues Roger## Miles## Derek and Liz## who so unselfishly stood in when we were away.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",,2015-08-30

1320,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Ballinger Sunday steamroller rumbles on!&nbsp; After completing our 1<sup>st</sup> win in living memory against Long Marston last week## Ballinger were far too good for Jordans Taverners this week.&nbsp; An excellent bowling and fielding performance reduced Jordans to 100 all out in just over 36 overs in a 40 over win/lose match.&nbsp; It took Ballinger only 23 overs and the loss of 2 wickets to knock off that total.&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Jordans had won the toss and elected to bat on a green and dampish pitch.&nbsp; Openers Evan Webster (2) and Nick Adams (1) both took early wickets and Jordans never really recovered.&nbsp; Both bowled straight## coping well with a left-right combination## and extracted plenty of life out of the helpful pitch.&nbsp; Hamish Sim and Monty Thompson then took over## Hamish in particular tying down the Jordans batsmen in a vice-like grip.&nbsp; Wickets fell steadily## maidens were commonplace and aggressive shots were comparatively rare given that it was a limited overs game. &nbsp;If it had not been for the very occasional 4-ball sent down by Ballinger (which the Jordans batsmen usually dispatched effectively)## the score would have been very low indeed.&nbsp; After taking an over to settle in## Monty bowled a combination of heavily-flighted deliveries and superfast darts (verging on the thankfully rarely to be seen &ldquo;Piggy-pace&rdquo;)## to claim a couple of wickets. &nbsp;Freddie Thompson joined the attack (insisting on bowling downhill &ndash; an unusual request for a legspinner)## claiming 3 wickets with his heavily spun leg-breaks - and## yes was that a googly?&nbsp; &nbsp;Jordans Taverners became slightly more expansive as the 30<sup>th</sup> over ticked by## but a returning Nick Adams then uprooted the stumps of the last 2 batsmen in the same over## so that Jordans ended up failing to use their overs.&nbsp; Frankly## each of the Ballinger bowlers was on the day too good for the Jordans batsmen.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Openers Nick Tegg and Rob McIntyre gave Ballinger a steady start until Nick drove excitedly at a wide one and was caught at cover.&nbsp; Rob was then joined by his younger son## James.&nbsp; The combination and the contrast was striking and effective &ndash; James driving elegantly front and back foot## Rob concentrating hard and advising patience; and both taking every opportunity to squeeze a single out of the slightly flat-footed fielding side. &nbsp;The run rate which had initially been about 3 an over (more than the required rate already) accelerated as James got into his stride. Rob played over one and was bowled for a very solid 27## but Will Smith joined James to see Ballinger home with more than 16 overs to spare## hitting a fine straight 6 which long on caught## before falling over the line (no Glenn Maxwells here).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">An enjoyable and emphatic end to a very successful season for the Sunday team## with only one defeat &ndash; and that was to High Wycombe!</p>",,2015-09-13
1447,<p>The Meadow in Chesham had a very end of season feel to it on Sunday and the way the Ballinger boys started this Cup final you'd have thought they'd already put their kit away for the season.</p> <p>Ollie Webb was in charge and he followed in a long line of Ballinger skippers this summer by losing the toss. Chesham chose to bat and## thanks to some very indifferent bowling accomapnied by some very suspect fielding## they were soon rocketing along. Suffice to say that they were scoring at nearly 8 an over for the first 8 overs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Edward brought some control to the proceedings as did Archie especialy when he took the first wicket to fall. Slowly the boys woke up and began to drag the run rate back. There was suddenly more urgency in the fielding and about their whole approach to the game but they just couldnt get the wickets needed to bring the score back to a more managable number. A wicket for Tom## who was the pick of the bowlers## followed by a run out from an Edward/Max combination meant that The Waggoners were chasing a sizeable total of 125. &nbsp;</p> <p>Chesham had a couple of very good early order batsmen including Tom Hortop## Kieran and Will Gilcrest. All 3 played very positively and made life hard for the early bowlers. I was impressed that we only gave away 4 wides and 1 no-ball.&nbsp;</p> <p>A quick check with the captain that he'd got his order sorted and off we went.</p> <p>The Chesham captain was a bit dis-organised as to who was bowling when but I dont think it would have made any difference to Seb and Raphi who was bowling. They set about chasing the target with such a composed approach it was difficult to believe they were both U11. After 4 overs they had made a sizeable dent in the target by taking 37 runs off them. Some wonderful shots and excellent pinching of singles great to watch.</p> <p>Fin and Kuran then added another 25 which was excellent because they were facing master Hortop who was quick. Tom and Max mixed cautious defence with some excellent shots and running between the wickets to add another 17 taking the total to 79 at the end of the 12th over. In front of the run rate!</p> <p>Archie and Edward now march to the crease. Archie strokes his first ball for 4 through the covers. This was the shot of the day and probably the best shot Ive seen all season. Another good over for the batting side follows but then there's a maiden. Sudenly we're still 14 runs short with 5 overs to go. Edward has only faced 3 balls at this stage so when he finaly gets the strike## in what is the pairs last over## he takes full advantage. First ball is over mid-wicket for 4 then the next 2 are drives through the covers for 4. 14 off the over means we're now infront.</p> <p>The skipper and Tim are up next. Ollie plays out a maiden## the crowd are getting excited## Tim plays and misses then connects with a couple and gets two 4s for his efforts. Can they keep their wickets. Defence is the order of the day but that doesnt register in Ollie's book as he hits his next ball for 2## follwed by a sumptious drive through the covers for 4.</p> <p>Lots of mental calculations going on as to how many in front we need to be especially as Chesham's &nbsp;M of M Hortop is back on. He's quick and Tim plays and misses## stops the next one## misses the next but then a snick gives him a sneaky 2 and it's all over we cant lose.</p> <p>A really impressive## composed run chase with some wonderful shots and excellent running between the wickets. Did anyone notice there was no mention of wickets lost. That's because they didnt lose any. Outstanding.</p> <p>A wonderful end to the season for the boys and thanks to all the parents who came to watch and support on the day and have done so throughout the season.</p> <p>Steve has done a great job of managing the boys throughout the season and this result is just reward for all his efforts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>,,2015-09-16
